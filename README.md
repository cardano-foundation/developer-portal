# Cardano Developer Portal

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8d3fae14-1136-4a30-8224-f5602a5a2360/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/staging-dev-portal/deploys)

We wanted to build a developer portal as open and inclusive as Cardano. A portal that is in the hands of the Cardano community and can be constantly evolved by it.

For this to be successful, the portal relies on your contributions, and the fact that you are reading this text probably means that you have something to contribute, even if you are not a Developer.
