# Cardano Developer Portal

Welcome to the Cardano Developer Portal. To make the difference between Cardano mainnet functionality and testnet functionality clearer, we moved the old content of developers.cardano.org to testnets.cardano.org with the launch of this developer portal.

We wanted to build an open and inclusive, easy to use developer portal that offers guidance and allows community contribution. To achieve this we have chosen [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Please find a detailed installation guide on [developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/). 


## Requirements:  

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12.13.0 or above

On macOS you also need Xcode and Command Line Tools.
