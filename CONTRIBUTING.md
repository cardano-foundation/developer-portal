# Contributing to the Developer Portal

üëçüéâFirst of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Developer Portal, which are hosted in the [Cardano Foundation](https://www.github.com/cardano-foundation) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

@TODO link

## I don't want to read all of this, I just have question!

Please check out our [Discussions section](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/discussions). Maybe you find a thread that answers your questions. If not, feel free to [open a new thread](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/discussions/new) and explain what you are wondering about. 

Discussions are also the place to talk about your ideas on how to improve the portal and engage with the developers.

## Project structure

Make yourself familiar with the [Project Structure](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-contribute/#project-structure). 

We try to keep everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. If you see something that could be improved you are encouraged to raise an issue wherein you propose your changes and explain the rationale.

## Showcase

The project showcase should be a place where someone new to the ecosystem can come to see what can be done - it should not be seen as a database where every project is promoted.

### Requirements for adding your project

* It must be built on Cardano and have a real use case. For example, a forum where people can talk about Cardano is great, but nothing for this showcase section.
* It has to run on Cardano mainnet.
* It has to have a running product. (no presale, no protected pages, no coming soon messages)
* It has to have enough community reputation. @TODO how to measure this?
* It has to provide a unique value from existing showcase items. (we can't list thousands of NFT or native tokens with the current UI)
* It has to have a stable domain name. (a random Netlify/Vercel domain is not allowed, no URL shortener, no app store links, or similar)
* The GitHub account that adds the project must not be new. 
* The GitHub account must have a history/or already be known in the Cardano community.

### Instructions to add your project

1. Add your project in the JSON array in the [src/data/showcases.js](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/edit/staging/src/data/showcases.js)
2. Add a description for your project that **describes what your project does**. Read more about descriptions [below](#a-word-about-project-descriptions]
3. Add a local image preview. (decent screenshot or logo of your project)
4. The image must be added to the GitHub repository and use `require("image")`. 
5. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for the `staging` branch.

#### A word about project descriptions

Descriptions help users find a project they are interested in and decide whether to visit the links you provided. Use relevant keywords and describe what your project is all about or that it does. Don't include claims in your description like *the **best** wallet*, *the **first** ABC* or *the **only** XYZ*. We will ask you to change the description in your pull request before merging. @TODO rationale?

## Pull Requests

To maintain the quality of content on the developer portal we use pull requests to integrate changes from contributors. 

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/portal-style-guide/)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track and resolve that problem.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
