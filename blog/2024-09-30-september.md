**_Hey, Charan, happy to connect today and learn more about the Nucast.io project. Can you tell us more about the project and the problem you are trying to solve?_**

Problem: In today's world, users often don’t truly own the content they pay for. Centralized entities retain control and power over digital assets.

Nucast is a technology company that builds blockchain-based solutions in the realm of digital property rights, ownership and live events. We create decentralized products that return true ownership of digital media to users and creators, all while promoting the adoption of the Cardano blockchain.


<br />

**_Can you introduce yourself and let us know what your role is in Nucast.io?_**

I'm Sricharan Ganta, the Founder & CEO of Nucast. 
My background is in entrepreneurship and business development, with over seven years of experience in business-driven roles and four years specifically in the web3 space. I've successfully delivered innovative products on the Cardano Blockchain, and I’m deeply passionate about community building and pioneering new solutions. 

At Nucast Labs, I lead a dynamic team of 14 professionals. I also hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Central Missouri, USA.


<br />

**_What are the most important things about Nucast.io that everyone should know?_**

Nucast was established in early 2023 with the goal of creating the technical infrastructure that supports true digital media ownership. By participating in the Nucast ecosystem, you can buy and stream iconic films and shows, attend live-streamed events, and purchase NFT tickets for real-world events through Nucast Ticketing. 

Our suite of products continues to grow and evolve and we remain deeply committed to developing solutions that advance Cardano, create better user experiences, and contribute to a thriving digital economy.


<br />

**_Why did you choose to launch your project on Cardano?_**

Nucast develops decentralized applications (dApps) that empower individuals to take control of their digital content. Our ethos strongly aligns with Cardano's values of self-sovereignty, transparency, and security. Our mission is to create the infrastructure that supports individuals' digital media rights.
 

<br />

**_Going forward, how will Nucast.io make an impact in the crypto space or on the world?_**

Nucast will continue to create solutions that empower true ownership of digital media and content. We're dedicated to ushering in a new era where Creators regain control, introduce innovative use cases to the Cardano ecosystem, and encourage widespread blockchain adoption to build a better system for everyone.

Nucast is also focused on driving growth initiatives for Cardano in South Asia. Over the past year and a half, we've established a strong track record of contributions in this region, and we plan to continue championing both our brand and the Cardano blockchain. 

This past summer of 2024, we led our second annual Cardano Hackathon, [CardanoCodex](https://www.cardanocodex.xyz/), which spanned three months, featured events in six cities, and engaged over 5,000 developers in one of the world’s largest and most dynamic Web3 landscapes. 

Looking ahead, Nucast is excited to host a Cardano Summit event this November for the second consecutive year, further solidifying our commitment to the Cardano ecosystem. 

With a diverse range of events, continuous product development, and a growing strategic network, Nucast is well-positioned to create the tools that will shape the future, all built on the Cardano blockchain.


<br />

**_Now, what are your accomplishments so far, and what are you most proud of?_**

Our greatest accomplishment in this space has been the development of our community. The nucast community is a rapidly growing group of individuals who understand and support our mission, and it’s what we’re most proud of. We recognize that our success is deeply rooted in the support we've received from the Cardano Community, and we’re genuinely grateful to be able to do what we love every day.

One of our early successes in 2023 was the release of the multi-award-winning international short film "Atman," which featured music by one of the most renowned Indian composers of all time. 

Additionally, we were honoured to provide NFT Ticketing support for the 2023 Cardano Summit and other community-led events. These opportunities allowed us to showcase nucast and demonstrate the value of what we've built. 


<br />

**_Why should people choose to use Nucast.io? What are the advantages over other blockchain-based video-streaming platforms?_**

Nucast prioritises true digital content ownership. When you purchase a nucast FilmNFT, you are purchasing a copy of the film/video itself. With some of the other platforms you’re simply holding a particular NFT to gain access to a video. With nucast you actually own the video.


<br />
