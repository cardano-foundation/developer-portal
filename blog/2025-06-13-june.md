In this session of the Cardano Developer Office Hours, Fabian Bormann, Team Lead of Ecosystem Engineering at the Cardano Foundation, presents UVerify, a lightweight tool for certifying and verifying data on Cardano without tokens or NFTs. He covers datums as an alternative to metadata, SDKs and white-label tools for devs, and real-world use cases like documents, credentials, and oracles. A live demo shows UVerify in action. The roadmap explores frictionless integrations and future opportunities for verifiable interactions across ecosystems.
