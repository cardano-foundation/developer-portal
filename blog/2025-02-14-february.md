This installment of the Cardano Developer Office Hours explores the Cosmos-Cardano Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) bridge project. The session provides an overview of the architecture, current development, and key components driving the project. Topics include the IBC protocol, blockchain interoperability, and the integration of Cosmos SDK with Cardano. A live demo showcases how to send messages between the Cosmos network and a local Cardano node. The session also covers real-world use cases like token transfers, cross-chain swaps, and more.
