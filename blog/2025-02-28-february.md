This installment of the Cardano Developer Office Hours explores Reeve, a next-generation accountability tool for delivering tamper-proof and transparent financial insights. Reeve integrates traditional accounting systems with blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, immutability, and security for financial records. Built on Cardano, the platform offers a decentralized approach to financial data management. Designed for accountants, auditors, non-profits, and enterprises, Reeve helps streamline audits, improve efficiency, and build trust in financial processes. The session provides an overview of the project, its architecture, and current development.
