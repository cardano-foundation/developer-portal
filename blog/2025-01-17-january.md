This 12th installment of the Cardano Developer Office Hours is presented by Satya Ranjan, Senior Enterprise Architect at the Cardano Foundation. In this session, Satya discusses how the yaci-devkit simplifies building and testing on a local Cardano dev network, helping developers iterate faster and avoid public testnet limitations. The session highlights key features such as customizable block times, integrated tools, and Blockfrost-compatible APIs. A live demo shows easy setup using Docker and NPM distributions.
