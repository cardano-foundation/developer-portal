Below is a well-deserved Q2 update highlighting ecosystem tooling and solutions across April, May, and June.

The past three months have been all about tightening up infrastructure, enhancing developer tools, and shipping valuable updates to support the Cardano ecosystem.
With over 90 pull requests merged and 60+ issues closed in June alone, it’s been a highly productive quarter. 

Check out the highlights below to see what’s been delivered.

## :gear: Cardano Rosetta Java

`cardano-foundation/cardano-rosetta-java`

**April**: 23 PRs merged focused on performance and stability:
- Spring Boot 3.4 + JDK 21 Virtual Threads
- Docker build-from-source support, Ubuntu 24.04
- Sync status upgrades, transaction serialization fixes, and Mithril patching
- Current release: `v1.2.7` → `v1.2.8` incoming (Mithril fix) → `v1.2.9` already in testing

**May**: Continued evolution of the Cardano Rosetta integration stack coming very soon:
- Upgraded to JDK 24 LTS and Spring Boot 3.4 for modern runtime compatibility
- Docker-based infrastructure improvements — cleaner container splits and environment handling
- Added support for building Postgres, Mithril, and Cardano Node from source in both single-container and Docker Compose setups — a key security feature over pulling pre-built images
- Retry mechanism added for better node submission resilience
- Cleaned up pruning variable usage, enhanced `/network/status` endpoint with `oldest_block`
- Closed issues include runtime upgrades, variable cleanup, and improved Docker orchestration for internal deployments

**June**: 18 PRs Merged | 5 Issues Closed

Wide-ranging fixes and enhancements throughout the Rosetta Java stack:
- Resolved issues with reward withdrawal, DRep vote delegation parsing, and nested token bundles in the /construction/parse endpoint
- Upgraded Docker setups for single-container builds (Cardano Node, Mithril, Postgres)
- Improved environment variable handling, renamed key config fields, and added retry logic
- Closed issues related to pruning behavior, stake balance endpoint responses, and internal release testing for v1.2.9

## :classical_building: Yaci Store

`bloxbean/yaci-store`

**April**: v2.0.0-beta1 Released — now with full ledger-state calculation! This is huge :exploding_head::heart_on_fire::_up_parrot_:
No need for DB Sync — Yaci Store independently derives rewards, ADAPot, and governance state from block data.

    - New API endpoints (Proposals, DReps, Rewards, AdaPot, Network Info)
    - Governance fixes (DRep expiry, snapshot handling)
    - Native image support, rollback improvements, docs upgrades

**May**: One of the most active repositories this month — with 13 PRs merged tackling governance data integrity, rollback logic, and infrastructure improvements

Major upgrades:
- Introduced Content-Aware Rollbacks to calculate data correct
- Improved proposal tracking and refund accuracy in governance modules
- Fixed Byron-era epoch lengths and slot duration mismatches on local devnet
- Switched to JDK 24 for runtime
- Closed a key issue improving governance and adapot module inclusion in yaci-store-all

**June**: 20 PRs Merged | 6 Issues Closed

Big month for Yaci Store — including the 2.0.0-beta2 pre-release!
- Introduced a powerful plugin framework for granular scope indexing with support for MVEL, SpEL, JS, and Python

- Implemented witness saving enable/disable option and epoch stake pruning
- Fixed native script parsing for the Preview network and adjusted stake filtering for inactive DReps
- Closed key issues related to adapot mismatches, Docker runtime configs, datasource cleanup, and governance metadata
- Positioned for broader extensibility and production-readiness with the 2.0.0-beta2 milestone
