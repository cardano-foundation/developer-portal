In this session of the Cardano Developer Office Hours, the team presents PoP (Proof of Provenance), a project to decentralize open-source development on Cardano. They cover risks of centralized infrastructure, using Cardano for verifiable software metadata, Merkle trees, and on-chain tracking. A live demo shows PoP in action. Use cases include secure versioning, on-chain test management, SPOs as decentralized oracles, and decentralized package tools.
