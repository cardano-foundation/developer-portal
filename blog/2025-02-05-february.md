This 13th installment of the Cardano Developer Office Hours is presented by Thomas Kammerlocher, Senior Full Stack Developer at the Cardano Foundation. Thomas discusses the Java implementation of Rosetta, a tool developed by Coinbase for exchanges to integrate with Cardano. Rosetta simplifies multi-chain support with its blockchain-agnostic API, and the transition from TypeScript to Java enhances performance and reduces resource consumption. Upcoming updates include support for staking rewards tracking, off-chain data integration, and more improvements to scalability and efficiency.
