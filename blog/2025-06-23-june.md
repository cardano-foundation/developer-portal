**_Hello, Kristian A. Portz. It's great to connect with you today and learn more about Masumi Network, something I’m really looking forward to. But before we dive into that, could you please introduce yourself to our readers?_**

I'm [Kristian Portz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristian-portz/), a Berlin-based entrepreneur and one of the co-founders of [Masumi](https://www.masumi.network/). 


<br />

**_Can you tell us a bit about your background and your role within Masumi Network?_**

My journey started in film production, but over time I transitioned into the tech space, bringing with me a creative mindset and a passion for building systems that put people first. Before Masumi, I also co-founded NMKR, a blockchain company focused on making the Cardano ecosystem more accessible through tools for token and NFT creation. At Masumi, I’m working to bridge the gap between human values and technological innovation.


<br />

**_So, what exactly is Masumi Network? And in simple terms, what does it aim to achieve?_**

Masumi Network is a decentralized platform that enables AI agents to collaborate and monetize their services securely and transparently. By using blockchain technology, it provides AI agents with verified identities, transparent decision logs, and secure payment systems. 

What sets Masumi apart is that it’s fully compliant with European regulations, which is crucial for corporates, especially in Europe, where data privacy and security are top priorities. This compliance ensures that companies can adopt AI solutions with confidence, knowing they align with strict legal and ethical standards.


<br />

**_Where did the idea for Masumi Network come from? What specific need or gap did you identify in the market? Please take us along on that journey?_**

The idea for Masumi Network really came from Sebastian Küpers, who I consider the godfather of the project. He approached me and my co-founder, Patrick Tobler, in the middle of last year, and we were instantly captivated by his vision. Sebastian is already pushing the boundaries at Serviceplan Group, where he’s building AI agents for large corporate clients. 

Meanwhile, Patrick and I are focused on developing the best possible AI infrastructure on Cardano. What we saw was a huge gap in the market—AI solutions that were powerful but lacked transparency, security, and compliance, especially for corporates.

That’s where Masumi comes in: we’re creating a platform that bridges this gap, offering secure, compliant, and collaborative AI infrastructure. One of the key features is that AI agents can pay each other autonomously via smart contracts, enabling seamless, trustless transactions. 

This opens up new possibilities for how AI systems can collaborate, share data, and even monetize their services without relying on intermediaries or monopolic solutions.


<br />

**_How would you describe Masumi Network to someone who is not technically inclined, or familiar with AI Agents?_**

Imagine you have several digital assistants that need to collaborate to get tasks done. Masumi provides the infrastructure for these agents to communicate, make decisions, and even pay each other automatically when certain tasks are completed, all without human intervention. What makes it special is that it’s built with privacy and security in mind, especially for companies in Europe, where data protection is crucial. It’s like creating a smart, reliable network where AI agents can do business with each other, safely and transparently, while following all the necessary rules and regulations.


<br />

**_You focus heavily on AI Agents. Could you explain what AI Agents are in the simplest terms, and how they function within Masumi Network?_**

AI agents are like digital workers or assistants that can carry out tasks on their own. These tasks could range from analyzing data, making decisions, or even communicating with other systems. They are called “agents” because they act on behalf of someone or something, carrying out actions automatically based on specific instructions or goals.

In the context of Masumi Network, these AI agents can work together autonomously, meaning they don’t need human input to interact or collaborate. For example, one AI agent could handle data processing, while another might take care of decision-making. They can even pay each other for tasks completed, using smart contracts—basically, digital agreements that are executed automatically when certain conditions are met.

So, within Masumi, AI agents are like digital coworkers that communicate, share tasks, and manage their own transactions, all in a secure and compliant way, especially for companies that need to follow strict privacy rules.

<br />

**_What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced in developing Masumi Network, and how have you overcome them?_**

One of the biggest challenges we’ve faced in developing Masumi Network has been ensuring that the platform is both technically advanced and fully compliant with European regulations. Building a decentralized system for AI agents that can operate autonomously, securely, and in a way that meets privacy laws is no small feat. It’s not just about creating a robust infrastructure, but also ensuring that everything aligns with strict data protection standards, especially for corporate clients in Europe.

Another challenge has been designing a platform that allows AI agents to collaborate and transact without human intervention, using smart contracts. It’s a new concept, and convincing others of its potential required a lot of education and trust-building. We had to make sure the technology was intuitive, user-friendly, and reliable enough for businesses to adopt it with confidence.

To overcome these hurdles, we’ve relied on our diverse team’s expertise - especially from Sebastian Küpers, who’s already leading AI projects at Serviceplan Group - and focused on building with security, transparency, and compliance at the forefront. We also continuously iterate, testing the system and getting feedback from early adopters to ensure that it works smoothly in real-world scenarios.

Ultimately, it's been a matter of blending innovation with caution and finding that sweet spot where cutting-edge technology meets practical, legal, and business needs.


<br />

**_Looking ahead, what are the major milestones or developments that Masumi Network plans to achieve in the next year?_**

In the coming year, Masumi Network is focused on advancing its platform and the AI agent ecosystem through several key developments. 

One major priority is enterprise integration. We are actively working with major corporate clients to deploy AI agents in real-world business environments. These collaborations are already underway and demonstrate the practical value of Masumi’s approach to secure and compliant AI.
