**_What is your role in the company?_**

My name is Ashish Prajapati, and I'm one of the co-founders of [strica.io](https://strica.io), a Cardano blockchain-focused development company.


<br />

**_Hey Ashish! Happy to connect today and learn more about Strica! Can you tell us more about the project and the problem you were addressing?_**

We are building products that enhance user experience using Cardano and enhance developer experience building on Cardano. [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io) and [Typhon Wallet](https://typhonwallet.io) are our well-known projects, and an upcoming project [flac.finance](https://flac.finance) is focused on processing payments and is being built on Cardano.

**_What are the most important things about Strica?_**

Strica is doing lots of open source work to grow the Cardano ecosystem [StricaHQ](https://github.com/StricaHQ). We have developed and open-sourced a full suite Cardano wallet library in pure javascript and Cardano key pair generation library in pure javascript. These libraries are used by Ledger and many marketplaces for building Cardano transactions in the browser. We have also developed a fully in-house CBORS package to serialize and deserialize the CBOR data types, focusing on working with Cardano data types.

We are working on more open source tools and packages to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.


<br />

**_Now, what are your accomplishments so far, and what are you most proud of?_**

Strica is proud to have developed a fully js-based Cardano wallet library from scratch. The library is used by [Typhon Wallet](https://typhonwallet.io), [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live), [Minswap](https://minswap.org/), and many more projects to build and sign Cardano transactions. This was achieved by building more core-level components in javascript. I would love everyone to check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/StricaHQ) and explore our open-source tools.

Recently we have worked on the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) integration of Cardano, one of the most requested features in the entire Cardano ecosystem.

We are also working on upgrading [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io) explorer to make it easy for new users to view and understand Cardano UTXO transactions and enhance the user experience. It will be a big release around the Vasil hard fork.


<br />

**_Why should people use Typhon Wallet and Cardanoscan? What are the advantages over other wallets and blockchain explorers?_**

Our goal behind [Typhon Wallet](https://typhonwallet.io) and [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io) is to provide the full feature sets possible on Cardano and provide the best user experience by utilizing the power of the Cardano blockchain.

With that in mind, [Typhon Wallet](https://typhonwallet.io) has unique, essential features in a very user-friendly design. One such feature we released recently is to be able to send ada to multiple different addresses with a single transaction by harnessing the power of UTXO. Many companies now use this to process salaries, for example. Typhon also allows attaching arbitrary metadata to a transaction and adding any number of tokens to a transaction.

[Typhon Wallet](https://typhonwallet.io) also supports transaction chaining. Users can submit as many transactions as possible without waiting for the previous transactions to get confirmed until they have enough ada balance.

[Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io) also follows the same philosophy of maximum features in user-friendly designs. [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io) is now mainly used by the Cardano community for their daily analytics requirements and to view transactions on the chain. We are also releasing a big re-designed version of [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io) around the time of the Vasil hard fork. We hope to make it easy for new Cardano users to view and understand Cardano transactions.


<br />

**_What does the future look like for Strica? For example, what new things are to come, and what will it mean for the overall project?_**

Strica is focused on building solutions on and around the Cardano blockchain. With our fleet of two live projects, one upcoming project [flac.finance](https://flac.finance), and our continued contribution to the open source Cardano tools and libraries, we are staying strong and building even during the crypto winter. This is our second crypto winter.
Strica also explores opportunities to build enterprise solutions on Cardano for enterprise clients.


<br />

**_Which partnerships have you engaged in so far, and which ones are the most impactful?_**

Strica has been working closely with many projects in the ecosystem, and some partnerships are officially announced, while for others, we continue to work with and help grow each other.

We are closely working together with,

* [Cardano Guild members](https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/)
* [Minswap](https://minswap.org/)
* [jpg.store](https://www.jpg.store/)

and many dApps and marketplace platforms in the ecosystem.
