Welcome to the March Developer Spotlight 2021. This month, we will focus on both educational content and stake pool tools. Read on to learn about **Cardano on the Rocks** and **JorManager**.

## 1. Cardano on the Rocks

![title image](/img/spotlight/cardano-on-the-rocks.png)

[Cardano on the Rocks](https://edu.clio.one/lessons/cardano-on-the-rocks/?tab=tab-overview) is a free educational project by CLIO1, which teaches users to build a Cardano node on a Rock Pi microcomputer.

Cardano on the Rocks describes the variety of hardware options you can choose from, all the way to how you can install and configure your stake pool on your Rock Pi computer. There are even instructions on how to [3D-print your very own case](https://edu.clio.one/lessons/cardano-on-the-rocks/lessons/3d-printed-case/), pictured above, for your Rock Pi node!

It’s a particularly interesting project for those who care about energy usage and requirements, as RockPi units only use up to 18 watts of power, as opposed to ASICs miners used in PoW blockchains that reach many hundreds of watts of power usage. Thank you, [Markus Gufler](https://forum.cardano.org/u/werkof), for your contributions!

## 2. JorManager

![title image](/img/spotlight/jormanager.png)

[JorManager](https://bitbucket.org/muamw10/jormanager) is an indispensable node-monitoring tool built by community member Andrew Westberg. Available through [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/muamw10/jormanager/src/develop/), JorManager provides tools and components for tracking stake pool performance, modifying pool fees, editing pool metadata, creating nodes, and more.

If you’re a new stake pool operator and you want a command center to help manage your pool, then JorManager is a fantastic resource. You’ll find everything you need to get started [here](https://bitbucket.org/muamw10/jormanager/src/develop/). You could even use these stake pool tools to manage your newly created RockPi pool!

Thank you [Andrew Westberg](https://forum.cardano.org/u/AndrewWestberg), your resources help our stake pool operator community work efficiently. Keep building!

## The Cardano Developer Spotlight

Each month, the Cardano Foundation will be selecting a couple of interesting community-led projects to discover and share with our wider ecosystem. We hope this will encourage those who are already building solutions on Cardano to keep moving forward, while also helping to inspire those thinking of building on Cardano to get started and collaborate.  

If you want to draw attention to a project, please introduce it in the [developer forums](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/29) under "Cardano Projects".
