Cardano offers one of the most comprehensive and decentralized funding ecosystems in blockchain. From grassroots innovation to large-scale infrastructure, find the right funding path for your project.

## Funding Options

### Project Catalyst

Project Catalyst is one of the world's largest decentralized grant programs, having distributed over **+$150M** across **+2000** funded proposals through community voting.

Visit the official [Project Catalyst website](https://projectcatalyst.io/) to explore current funding opportunities and active campaigns.

#### How It Works

Project Catalyst operates in three phases:

1) Community responds to challenges with ideas. Brainstorming leads to conceptualization, feedback, and finalized proposals.

2) Participants vote on proposals they wish to see funded.

3) Selected projects receive milestone-based funding with community reviewer feedback loop and progress reports.

### Treasury Withdrawals

For mature projects with proven impact, Cardano's on-chain governance enables **Treasury withdrawals**. Ada funding proposals voted on by the community.

**When to Consider:**

- Established project with proven product-market fit
- Significant ecosystem impact and utilization
- Large-scale infrastructure or protocol improvements
- Community-wide benefit and long-term value

Anyone can submit treasury withdrawal proposals, which require approval from **DReps** (Delegated Representatives) and the **Constitutional Committee** through Cardano's governance system. Organizations like [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) and [PRAGMA](https://pragma.builders) can serve as administrators to help coordinate due diligence, contracting, and disbursements for approved proposals.
