description: Receive real-time blockchain event notifications via HTTP POST.
---

Blockfrost Secure Webhooks notify your application when relevant blockchain events occur, eliminating the need to poll for data continously.

Webhooks deliver events to your endpoint via HTTP POST in JSON format. Create up to 5 trigger conditions per webhook to filter events. Conditions use field/value/operator rules with predefined fields or custom JSONPath queries.
