To get the most out of the Cardano Developer Portal, you should have programming experience and a basic understanding of blockchain concepts. This section provides comprehensive coverage of Cardano's technical foundations, organized into key areas for easier learning and reference.

## [Core Blockchain Fundamentals](core-blockchain-fundamentals)

Learn the foundational concepts that power Cardano's blockchain technology:

- **Introduction to Cardano** - Understand the big picture and Cardano's unique architecture
- **Extended UTXO (EUTXO)** - Cardano's innovative accounting model that enables smart contracts on the UTxO model
- **Transactions** - How transactions work, fees, and guaranteed delivery
- **Addresses** - Cardano's address system
