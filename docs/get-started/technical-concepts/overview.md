To get the most out of the Cardano Developer Portal, you should have programming experience and a basic understanding of blockchain concepts. This section provides comprehensive coverage of Cardano's technical foundations, organized into key areas for easier learning and reference.

## What You'll Learn

Understanding these concepts is essential for building on Cardano. Unlike account-based blockchains, Cardano uses the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model, which requires a different mental model for transactions, state management, and smart contracts.

### Why Start Here?

- **EUTXO is fundamental** - Everything from transactions to smart contracts works differently
- **Security-first design** - Learn how Cardano's cryptographic foundations protect your applications
- **Staking as a feature** - Understanding consensus helps you build better dApps
