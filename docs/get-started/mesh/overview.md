Mesh is an open-source TypeScript library providing everything you need to build applications on the Cardano blockchain with ease. It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh) (star our repo!) and published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@meshsdk/core) (check out weekly downloads).

Like a well-woven fabric, Mesh connects business goals with technology stacks. It enables developers to build applications according to project requirements on the blockchain. Mesh is filling the gap by making product development accessible on Cardano.

Whether you're a new developer, a startup, or a large enterprise, Mesh makes Web3 development easy with reliable, scalable, and well-engineered APIs & developer tools.
