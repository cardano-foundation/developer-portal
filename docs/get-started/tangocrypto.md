# What is Tangocrypto?

We provide a suite of high availability APIs and developer tools for fast and reliable access to the Cardano network that requires only 1 minute to integrate. Every developer starting on Cardano will face the following problems:
- There's no way to access the information on a blockchain without using a node.
- You will have to start creating the infrastructure instead of focusing on your products and business. 
- In-house infrastructure doesn‚Äôt scale automatically when user demand increases.
- There is a high learning curve, a broader error surface and increase in cost when building integrations with several API services from multiple providers.
- There is not a single platform with all the tools most businesses need, leading to multiple platform hiring and cost increase.

We provide an unified platform where developers are able to: 
- Ship products faster and validate business ideas.
- Use one platform to fetch, submit and listen on-chain information, mint tokens, store files and process payments.  
- Grow their user base by relying on an elastic infrastructure capable of handling spikes in consumption without downtime. 
- Reduce cost on engineering and infrastructure operations. 

Our solution provides the following components:
- REST API
- Notify (Webhooks)
- NFT API

## REST API
The HTTP REST API goal is to make development faster and easier. There is no need for syncing with the blockchain and maintaining complicated setups. No more complex and multiple requests to the blockchain from different entry points, the developers can get all the data they need for transactions, token information and debug, in fewer requests.

We provide the most accessible and reliable Cardano infrastructure, freeing companies and developers from the responsibility to maintain complex infrastructures and focus instead on building their business logic and provide value to their customers. 

- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure**: Harness the processing power of our globally distributed cloud-hosted node network. Our API alleviates the friction of maintaining your own compute and storage resources, lowering the barrier to entry for developers and enterprises.
- **Built for developers**: Easy to read documentation and resources to help developers get started quickly.
- **Gain app insights**: Our dashboard provides direct insights about API usage. Drill down into specific request methods and get response times, most used endpoints, usage by time of the day, IP address, countries and more. These insights are a great way to optimize applications based on user behaviour.
- **Standard Interface**: Supports Mainnet and Testnet via client-compatible REST API over HTTPS.
- **Always Online**: Running on the latest network upgrades with a minimum 99.9% uptime guarantee.

### Network and App ID

You can choose the mainnet or the testnet for your queries. The API requires a valid `app_id` to be included with your request traffic. This identifier should be appended to the request URL.

| Network          |   Endpoint      
| ---------------- | :-----------: 
| Cardano mainnet  | https://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/{app_id}/v1 
|Cardano testnet   |   https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/{app_id}/v1 


### API Key header
When you sign up on https://www.tangocrypto.com and create an App an `x-api-key` is created. You must include the HTTP header `x-api-key` in every request in order to authenticate the API calls.

### Steps to get started with Tangocrypto

#### 1. üîë Create an App

To use Tangocrypto's products, you need an API key to authenticate your requests.

You can [create API keys from the dashboard](https://dashboard.tangocrypto.com/home/dashboard), just click on +Create App, name it and hit create:

![alt text](../../static/img/get-started/tangocrypto/app.png)


Once your app is created just copy you app-id and `x-api-key` and start making requests.

![alt text](../../static/img/get-started/tangocrypto/tangocrypto_app_details.png)

#### 2. ‚úâÔ∏è Make a Request 
With the app-id and the `x-api-key` you can make requests. For example, let's make a request to get the latest block number:

```shell
curl --location \
--request GET 'https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/blocks/latest' \
--header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>'
```

You should get something like this:
```json
{
    "id": "3064146",
    "hash": "f8eadfc91c3219b3d00d4a902174e0978e449f0e8a6f6b0584e06bbbedc0d050",
    "epoch_no": 158,
    "slot_no": 38197024,
    "epoch_slot_no": 310624,
    "block_no": 2940877,
    "previous_block": 2940876,
    "slot_leader": "pool1rcsezjrma577f06yp40lsz76uvwh7gne35afx3zrq2ktx50f8t8",
    "size": 365,
    "time": "2021-09-25T10:37:20.000Z",
    "tx_count": "1",
    "out_sum": "435928446",
    "fees": "171441",
    "op_cert": "333e175db9a2f89de5d9396c10b4dd136c3fffebd7f22d2eb0a3e8ef3884199c",

    "confirmations": 1
}
```

#### Pagination

Some API endpoints paginate their responses to make the result set easier to handle. For example, if you request a list of objects that are potentially too large to run efficiently, the endpoint returns the first batch of results along with a cursor to access the next set of results. 

The query results are divided into "pages" of 1 MB in size (or less) data. An application can process the first page of results, then the second page, etc. You include the cursor in subsequent requests to the endpoint as a URL query parameter of your request. 

To determine whether there are more results and to retrieve them one page at a time, applications should do the following:
<ol>
<li>Make a request with the desired `size` and check the result, if the cursor is not empty, construct a new request with the same parameters</li> as the previous one. However, this time, take the cursor value from the last query and use it as the cursor parameter in the new request.
<li>If the `cursor` is empty in the result it means there are no more items to be retrieved.</li>
</ol>

#### Example
Let's make the following query with size=50
```
https://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections?size=50
```

In the response, we see the cursor with a non-empty value (showing only one record for simplicity)

    },
    "status_code": 200
}
```

To retrieve the next batch of items we use the same query but now inserting the obtained cursor from the previous step as a the query parameter:

```
https://cardano-mainnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections?size=50&cursor=a97f98a8c533ee55fc2c6897c9b50506dc8d65b921092e469f62f9d0e2d0dc92902605dba96d30b2e027557d3d6ea8cb3c1597d93e36f9c70771f19485f176607d834f6bc4fd664e0f68d4c28eff52cc298dee1dc17975c043d05903c31dae41ff84c779f1f8d2bcc00447e25d066a4e
```

This process can be repeated until the cursor is empty because there are no more items to retrieve. 


## NOTIFY (WEBHOOKS)
With Notify you'll will be able to integrate production-ready notifications with our webhooks and SDKs integrations. Get access to all of the blockchain events your users might care about, like successful transactions, payments, minted blocks by a pool, new delegations and whatnot.

![alt text](../../static/img/get-started/tangocrypto/notify.png)

- **Payments and transactions**: Allows sending notifications to users to know when their deposits, purchases, in-game actions or other on-chain activity has officially occurred.
- **Address Activity Webhooks**: Let your users know when transaction activity occurs on their address. No more refreshing the page or having to use the dust to identify a payment.
- **Smart Retries**: Sometimes receiving endpoints fails or hangs more often than you think. That‚Äôs why we provide automatic retries to ensure deliverability.
- **Monitoring and debug**: We log every triggered webhook so you can monitor their deliverability to different endpoints, disable failing ones and notify your customers.
- **Development experience**: Offer your users a great developer experience, including the ability to test and inspect their webhooks.


### What are Webhooks?
A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it real-time. This makes webhooks much more efficient for both provider and consumer. Webhooks work by registering a URL to send notifications once certain events occur.

You can think that Webhooks are like a phone number that Tangocrypto calls to notify you of activity in Cardano. The activity could be a payment to an address or reaching a particular epoch. The webhook endpoint is the person answering that call who takes actions based upon the specific information it receives.

A webhook endpoint is just more code on your server, which could be written in Node.js, Go, Java, Ruby, or whatever. The webhook endpoint has an associated URL (e.g. https://myserver.com/callback). The Tangocrypto notifications are Event objects. This Event object contains all the relevant information about what just happened, including the type of event and the data associated with that event. The webhook endpoint uses the event details to take any required actions, such as indicating that an NFT should be sent to a wallet. 

:::note
Webhooks vs. WebSockets:
The difference between webhooks and WebSockets is that webhooks can only facilitate one-way communication between two services, while WebSockets can facilitate two-way communication between a user and a service, recognizing events and displaying them to the user as they occur.
:::

### Event standard structure

The Event structure always begins with the following parameters:
```json
{
    "id": "2921e3df-c671-4d20-b51b-d176d5c1e43g", //** Unique uuid per event .**
    "api_version": "1.0", //**Represents the current Tangocrypto API version, which is v1.**
    "webhook_id": "d012a60eccb54c2ba97484f98137be56", // identifies the webhook
    "idempotency_key": "3b3359d0ccdb1d3d3ca8dbaa79cb5395b33c5bc52d782f3ea22904abef45d1j4", //**Specifies a unique ID used by Tangocrypto to recognize consecutive requests with the same data so that not to perform the same operation twice.**
    "object": "event",
    "create_date": 1633954086377,
    "type": "payment", // event type
    ...
}
```
`id`
Unique identifier per Event. 

`api_version`
The event scheme you receive depends on the version of the Tangocrypto API. Currently, we use v1. When you set a subscription for an event while using v1 of the API, the callback will be returned according to v1 specifics.
Each time we update our API to the next version you will have to reset your Event subscriptions so that they correspond to the newest version currently in use. To do that you'll need to remove the event subscription and set it up again. Otherwise, the callback response will be received in the format of the older API version it was set up in.

`webhook_id`
The webhook_id indicates a reference to the webhook and It's is a unique code. Each time you set up an event subscription, the corresponding Event always has a parameter `webhook_id`.

`idempotency_key`
Idempotency represents a process in computing and REST that a server uses to recognise subsequent retries of the same request where the returned result always remains the same. It is a security mechanism for retrying requests without the risk of performing the same operation more than once.

Such risks usually can occur when an API call is for some reason disrupted during processing (e.g. network connection error) and a response is not returned. In such cases, the API call would be retried. By including an idempotency_id in the initial request there is a guarantee that the specific action won‚Äôt be done more than once.
The `idempotency_id` is generated only by Tangocrypto webhooks. It is added to the Event and is unique per triggered webhook. 

### Types of Webhooks
Tangocrypto offers 5 different types of webhooks:
- Payments
- Block
- Transaction
- Epoch
- Delegation

Callback requests sent from Tangocrypto are always POST and it contains a JSON payload;

### 1. Payment
The Payment Webhook allows you to track payments to an address. This provides your app with real-time state changes when an address sends or receives tokens.

### Trigger Rules
 You can create rules or trigger conditions for every webhook. You can create rules through the Tangocrypto Dashboard or the API.  Every rule is composed of a `field`, a `value` and an `operator`. All the conditions have to be met for the webhook to be triggered. Rules are optional; depending on the number of rules and their parameters, the webhook will be triggered or not.

**Example**
Trigger the webhook when the address receives more than 5 RBERRY tokens:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/webhooks' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: <x-api-key>' \
--data-raw '{
    "type": "payment",
    "name": "Payment webhook",
    "network": "testnet",
    "description": "Notify on payment with more than 5 RBERRY",
    "callback_url": "https://webhook.site/74e4201b-d651-4971-8b74-ebd6b10fd967",
    "address": "addr_test1qqqv50804vhe30n25awp6f8mhy9z3rrysva2mj4c9geaqyjr5gtdwq4yajng57kje93tt3fkc5k8cvvem7vl8yql2mcsxcstnx",
    "rules": [
        {
            "field": "asset_name",
            "operator": "=",
            "value": "RBERRY"
        },
        {
            "field": "quantity",
            "operator": ">",
            "value": "5"
        }
    ]
}'
```

Rules can be created also from the dashboard:

## NFT API

### 1 - Create an NFT collection
The first step is to create a collection using the following parameters.
Parameters

- **`name`**: (Mandatory) Collection name. The collection name is internal to your Tangocrypto account. This is just a way to identify different collections.
- **`description`**: (Optional) Collection description. The collection description is internal to your Tangocrypto account.
- **`url`**: (Optional) URL of the website where the collection is going to be sold.
- **`payout_address`**:(Mandatory) Wallet address that is going to receive the payments of the NFT sale. This should be the wallet address of the seller.
- **`policy`**: (Mandatory) Policy configuration for every NFT in the collection. When you create a new collection we do several steps in the background; we create a new key pair (public verification key/private signing key), a policy script and the policy id. Then during the sale process, all the tokens are minted with the same policy script and the policy id is attached permanently to the NFT.
- **`lock`**: (Mandatory) true | false Defines if the policy will be locked or not. If you select falsethen you are not required to choose a date and time to lock the policy, therefore the policy will be open and you can be minting NFTs under this policy forever.  If you set this parameter to true then you have to specify a locktime date. 
- **`locktime`**: (Optional) Locktime date in ISO 8601 format `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]`. It defines how long you'll be able to mint NFTs for the collection. The policy will lock after that date, and you won't be able to mint more NFTs using the same policy id (even if you use the same key). Hours and minutes are optional; if you set it to2022-02-24, it will automatically fill it with 0s, for example, 2022-02-24T00:00:00.000Z.
Take into consideration the desirability and size of your collection before setting this date and leave enough time for selling the NFTs. There is no limited time for the future.
- **`metadata`**: (Mandatory) Metadata tag for the collection. The values between < > mean that they are tags. A tag is simply a variable that we will assign its value when you mint the NFT. You can use the metadata tag to define common attributes shared by all the NFTs in the collection, like the name, copyright, date issued, artist name, social media links, etc. You can override all the attributes while creating the individual NFTs.
- **`asset_name`**: (Mandatory) Metadata tag for the NFT asset name.
- **`name`**: (Mandatory) Metadata tag for the NFT name.
- **`description`**: (Optional) Metadata tag for the NFT description.
- **`media_type`**: (Optional) Metadata tag for the media type.
- **`files`**: (Optional) array of files used for files. This is used when you want to create an NFT with different file formats. For example, you can create several audio files and add them to the metadata. 
- **`media_type`**: (Optional) same as the previous description.
- **`name`**: (Optional) Asset name of the file
- **`src`**: `<file_link>` (Optional) Tag to reference on token overrides. We expect a base64 string to be hosted on IPFS.
- **`attributes`**: (Optional) Custom attributes or traits for an NFT. You can create 2 types of attributes, fixed or variables. 
- **`fixed`**: We include these attributes in the metadata of every NFT minted in the collection with a fixed value. You can add attributes like artist name, Twitter, Discord, copyright etc. You define their value here, and then you don't have to submit them during the NFT creation step.
- **`variables`**: Here you define a tag, which means that we'll replace this tag with a value you'll have to provide during the NFT creation step. As you can see in the example below, we defined five traits (colour, body, eyes, face, and accessories), but we don't specify the value, just a tag between the angle brackets `<>`.

### 2 - Create NFT
The next step is to create the NFTs for the collection. Use the following endpoint with the collection-id returned in step 1 as part of the path.
```bash
POST https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections/<collection-id>/tokens
```

**Parameters**
- **`name`**: (Mandatory) Display name. Between 2 and 32 characters (maximum 64 bytes for UTF-8 encoded).
- **`asset_name`**: (Mandatory) Take into consideration is the name is case sensitive and is between 2 and 32 characters (maximum 64 bytes for UTF-8 encoded).
- **`description`**: (Optional) Token description. Between 2 and 32 characters (maximum 64 bytes for UTF-8 encoded).
- **`media_type`**: (Optional) Media type. It is common to have NFTs with MIME-type imag, audioand video. For example: 
- - image/gif: Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).
- - image/jpeg: Joint Photographic Expert Group image (JPEG).
- - image/png: Portable Network Graphics (PNG).
- - audio/wav: Waveform audio file format (WAV).
- - video/mp4: MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4).
- **image**:  (Mandatory) base64 encoded image or already pinned image in IPFS. For example, ipfs://QmP4sEnaYa1fhLTFVTUq5E8d8XvEtxBS7NE5M3TACUtSxh or through an IPFS gateway https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmP4sEnaYa1fhLTFVTUq5E8d8XvEtxBS7NE5M3TACUtSxh.
- **`metadata_attributes`**: You have to specify the values for the placeholder attributes for every token as defined in the collection attribute placeholder definition in Step 1. Please take into consideration that we have to define these values for every single NFT in the collection. For example, we set the colour, body, eyes, face and mime type for that particular NFT. 
- - tag: Use the tag to match the placeholder defined in the collection.
- - value: Use the value to set a value for the placeholder tag.
- **`custom_attributes`**: Here you can set any arbitrary attributes that you didn't include in the collection attributes placeholder definition. Use key-value pairs to define unique attributes for each NFT.

### 3 - Sell NFTs
The next step is to sell NFTs in the collection. Use the following endpoint with the collection-id returned in step 1 as part of the path and the token id from step 2.

```bash
POST https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections/<collection-id>/tokens
```

- **`collection-id`**: (Mandatory) Collection ID returned in step 1
- **`type`**: fixed | random. (Mandatory) Use fixed for selling a particular token or token list identified by the token-id. Use random for random sales, it will pick random tokens from the collection.
- **`lock_time`**: (Mandatory) Reservation time in seconds. This timer defines how long an NFT will be reserved once a potential buyer starts the buying process. During this time interval, the NFT won't be available for sale. No other buyer will be able to create a new reservation. If the payment is not received and this timer expires, then the NFT is ready for sale again, and it can be reserved by another buyer.
- **`price`**: (Mandatory) Individual token price in Lovelaces (1 ADA = 1000000 Lovelaces).
- **`tokens`**: (Mandatory) Array of token IDs returned in step 2. Used in fixed sell.

The sale can have different states:
- `RESERVED`: The NFT is reserved and we are waiting for payment.  
- `RESERVATION_EXPIRED`: No payment was received and the reservation time expired. In order to add this token for sale again, you need to create another reservation calling the same endpoint.
- `NFT_SENT`: Payment is received and the NFT was sent to the buyer. 

:::important
Every time you call this endpoint you'll get a new sale and thus a new payment address.

**Example**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://cardano-testnet.tangocrypto.com/<app-id>/v1/nft/collections/61919f96e7020f542f502510/sales' \
--header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "type": "fixed",
    "price": 6000000,
    "lock_time": 300000,
    "tokens": ["6189bd6e73c4ab1a0c08eee1"]
}'
```
Result
The result contains the sale `id` and the `address` for the payment. Every time you generate a sale you'll get a new sale id and address.

```bash
