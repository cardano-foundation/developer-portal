### Overview 

This guide will show you how to run `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` on your system and some simple examples of how you can interact with the **Cardano** blockchain.

:::note
This guide assumes you installed `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your system. If not, you can refer to [Installing cardano-node](docs/get-started/cardano-node/installing-cardano-node.md) guide for instructions on how to do that.
:::

:::important
This guide does not cover the topic of running a block-producing `cardano-node` or running a **Cardano Stake Pool**. For more information regarding that topic, please visit the [Stake Pool Operation](/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/) section.
:::

## Cardano blockchain  nets:
### Testnet
There are two types of testnet: `preview` and `pre-prod`.

- **Preview Testnet**: Testing release candidates and Mainnet releases. Leads Mainnet hard forks by at least 4 weeks. This net is for those who just want to see how it runs, get familiarised and play with cardano-node.

- **Pre-Production Testnet**: Testing release candidates and Mainnet releases. Forks at approximately same time as Mainnet (within an epoch of each other). This net is ideal for those who are ready to run the Mainnet but want to test it before running it.

### Production (Mainnet)
This is the live Production. Only gets official Mainnet releases. Please use this net once you are ready to use the cardano-node.

### Configuration Files

The `cardano-node` application requires at least four configuration files to run as of writing this article.

- **Main Config**: It contains general node settings such as **logging** and **versioning**. It also points to the **Byron Genesis** and the **Shelly Genesis** file.
- **Byron Genesis**: It contains the initial protocol parameters and instructs the `cardano-node` on how to bootstrap the **Byron Era** of the **Cardano** blockchain.
- **Shelly Genesis**: It contains the initial protocol parameters and instructs the `cardano-node` on how to bootstrap the **Shelly Era** of the **Cardano** blockchain.
- **Alonzo Genesis**: It contains the initial protocol parameters and instructs the `cardano-node` on how to bootstrap the **Alonzo Era** of the **Cardano** blockchain.
- **Conway Genesis**: It contains the initial protocol parameters and instructs the `cardano-node` on how to bootstrap the **Conway Era** of the **Cardano** blockchain.
- **Topology**: It contains the list of network peers (**`IP Address` and `Port` of other nodes running the blockchain network**) that your node will connect to.

:::important
Currently, the `cardano-node` topology is manually set by the community of network operators in the **Cardano** blockchain. But an automated p2p (peer-to-peer) system is in the works. For more information visit, [Boosting network decentralization with P2P](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/06/boosting-network-decentralization-with-p2p/).

For more information about **Cardano** blockchain eras and upgrades, please visit the [Cardano Roadmap](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en).

:::note

Each network has a `config` file, `genesis` file(s), `topology` file, and unique identifier called the **Network Magic**.

This section will be updated when new **Cardano** networks come online with their respective configuration files and **Network Magic**.
:::

You might be asking what the difference is between `mainnet` and `testnet` and why there are two official network types? To put it simply, **Cardano** is an open-source blockchain, and anyone is free to spin up a network based on **Cardano's** software components. The `mainnet` network was the first one established during the start of the **Byron** era in 2017.  And everyone participating in the network agreed that is where all the real value of **Cardano** lives.

Testing the network's features and capabilities can be expensive and will consume real value. So [Input-Output Global](https://iohk.io) has spun up sandboxes or testnet versions of the network. Instead of using real `ada` tokens for transactions, you use the `tAda` or **Test ADA**. Alternatively, you can spin up your own custom **Cardano** network, but that is outside the scope of this guide.

### Running the node

To run `cardano-node` you enter something like this into the terminal: 

```bash
 cardano-node run \
   --topology path/to/mainnet-topology.json \
   --database-path path/to/db \
   --socket-path path/to/db/node.socket \
   --host-addr x.x.x.x \
   --port 3001 \
   --config path/to/mainnet-config.json
```

### cardano-node parameters

:::note
In this section, we will use the path `$HOME/cardano/testnet` to store all the testnet `cardano-node` related files as an example, and please replace it with the directory you have chosen to store the files.
:::

We will focus on six key command-line parameters for running a node: 

**`--topology`**: This requires the path of the `topology.json` file that you have downloaded as instructed [above](docs/get-started/cardano-node/running-cardano.md#configuration-files).

> For example, If you have downloaded the `topology.json` file to the path `$HOME/cardano/testnet/topology.json`, then the argument would be something like this:
```
--topology $HOME/cardano/testnet/topology.json
```

**`--database-path`**: This expects the path to a directory where we will store the actual blockchain data like **blocks**, **transactions**, **metadata**, and other data type that people stored in the **Cardano** blockchain. We explore how we can query those kinds of data in the cardano-db-sync section. ***@TODO: link to the cardano-db-sync section.***

> For example, if we decide that all files required by `cardano-node` will be in the path `$HOME/cardano/testnet`. Then we could create a database directory like this, `mkdir -p $HOME/cardano/testnet/db`.
> The directory structure would then be something like this:
```
$HOME/cardano/testnet/
â”œâ”€â”€ db
â”œâ”€â”€ alonzo-genesis.json
â”œâ”€â”€ byron-genesis.json
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ shelley-genesis.json
â””â”€â”€ topology.json
â”œâ”€â”€ alonzo-genesis.json
â”œâ”€â”€ byron-genesis.json
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ shelley-genesis.json
â””â”€â”€ topology.json
1 directory, 4 files
```
> As you may have noticed, we are planning to run a testnet node in this example and have downloaded the configuration files into the `$HOME/cardano/testnet/` directory. We also see that we have created the `db` directory inside `$HOME/cardano/testnet/` successfully. The argument would look something like this: 
```
--database-path $HOME/cardano/testnet/db
```
> Please download and move the configuration files to your Cardano directory as shown above to continue following this guide.

**`--socket-path`**: This expects the path to the `unix socket` or `named pipe` path that the `cardano-node` will use for [IPC (Inter-Process-Communication)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication).

> The `cardano-node` uses **IPC (Inter-Process-Communication)** for communicating with other **Cardano** components like `cardano-cli`, `cardano-wallet`, and `cardano-db-sync`. In **Linux** and **MacOS** it uses something called [unix sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) and [Named Pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes) in **Windows**.
> 
> Here is an example `--socket-path` argument for **Linux**:
```
--socket-path $HOME/cardano/testnet/db/node.socket
```
> As you can see, the argument points to a file since **unix sockets** are represented as files (like everything else in **Linux**). In this case, we put the socket file in the `db` directory that we have just created before.
> 
> In **Windows**, the `--socket-path` argument would look something like this:
```
--socket-path "\\\\.\\pipe\\cardano-node-testnet"
```
> As you may notice, it's like a network `URI` or a network `Path` than a file. It is a crucial difference that you will have to be aware of depending on your operating system. You can replace the string `cardano-node-testnet` in the argument with whatever you like. This example path is used in the [Daedalus Testnet Wallet](https://daedaluswallet.io) for **Windows**.
>

**`--host-addr`**: This expects the `IP Address` of the machine that `cardano-node` will be running. Other nodes will use this address in their `topology.json` file to connect to your node if you are planning to run it as a `relay` node.
> Here is an example `--host-addr` argument:
```
--host-addr 192.168.0.1
```
> In this case, we expect nodes in your [LAN (Local Area Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) to connect via `192.168.0.1`, assuming that the `IP Address` of the machine `cardano-node` is running on; replace it with your real `IP Address`. If you don't expect or need external nodes to connect to your node, you can use the loopback address `127.0.0.1`. If you have multiple network interfaces and unsure what to use, you can simply use `0.0.0.0` to accept connections from any network interface.

**`--port`**: In conjunction with the `IP Address`, we will also set the `port` that your `cardano-node` will use for listening to any incoming connection.
> Here is an example `--port` argument:
```
--port 1337
```
> You can choose whatever `port` number you like, but it is recommended to use `port` numbers `1024` and above. See [Registered Port](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/registered-port) for more information.

**`--config`**: This expects the path to the main configuration file that we have downloaded previously.
> Here is an example `--config` argument:
```
--config $HOME/cardano/testnet/config.json
```
> Please make sure that the `alonzo-genesis.json`, `byron-genesis.json` and `shelley-genesis.json` are in the same directory as the `config.json`.

Here is a realistic example for running `cardano-node`:

```bash
cardano-node run \
--config $HOME/cardano/testnet/config.json \
--database-path $HOME/cardano/testnet/db/ \
--socket-path $HOME/cardano/testnet/db/node.socket \
--host-addr 127.0.0.1 \
--port 1337 \
--topology $HOME/cardano/testnet/topology.json
```

If you have everything set correctly, you should see something like this:

```

Syncing the blockchain from zero can take a while. Please be patient. If you want to stop syncing, you can do so by pressing `CTRL` + `C` while in the terminal. Rerunning the `cardano-node run` command with the correct parameters will resume syncing the blockchain.

### Querying the Cardano Blockchain

Now that we have `cardano-node` running and syncing, we can test it out by querying the blockchain tip data; which is the current point your local node is synced. To do this, we use the `cardano-cli` command-line application.

But before we can do that, `cardano-cli` and other **Cardano** software components need to know where the node socket file is located. We saved it to the path `$HOME/cardano/db/node.socket` in the previous example. The components read the shell environment variable `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` to find this.

So we will set that in `$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.zshrc`, depending on which shell application that you use. In Windows, you can follow this guide: [How to Set Environment Variable in Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable).

Add this line to the bottom of your shell profile (**MacOS** and **Linux**):
```
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH="$HOME/cardano/testnet/db/node.socket"
```

Once saved, reload your shell/terminal for changes to take effect.

Finally, we can now test querying the blockchain tip of our `cardano-node`:

- First, run `cardano-node` in a separate terminal for it to start syncing (if not already).
- Open another terminal and run the following command `cardano-cli query tip --testnet-magic 1`.

> You should see something like this:
```json
{
    "block": 2598870,
    "epoch": 133,
    "era": "Shelley",
    "hash": "7b5633590bf8924d8fce5b6515f34fga0c712f64e9b7d273f915656f88fba872",
    "slot": 27149964,
    "syncProgress": "57.09"
    "block": 2598870,
    "epoch": 133,
    "era": "Shelley",
    "hash": "7b5633590bf8924d8fce5b6515f34fga0c712f64e9b7d273f915656f88fba872",
    "slot": 27149964,
    "syncProgress": "57.09"
}
```

:::note
We include `--testnet-magic <NetworkMagic>` in the parameter for `cardano-cli query tip` because we are using a testnet node. If you intend to query `mainnet` instead, please use the `--mainnet` parameter  and make sure your node is connected to the `mainnet` network.
:::

What you see here is the local tip data of your node. This case, means that you are synced up to `block: 2598870` and `slot: 27149964`.

`syncProgress` is the percentage your node that has been synced. `100` meaning it is fully synced.

To know whether you are fully synced or not, you can check the **Cardano Blockchain Explorer** of the relevant network:

#### Mainnet Explorer
[https://explorer.cardano.org](https://explorer.cardano.org)

#### Testnet Explorer
[https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/)
[https://preview.cardanoscan.io/](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/)

Scroll down to the **Latest Blocks** section, and you can find the latest network tip.
