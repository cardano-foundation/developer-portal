This is a library for serialization & deserialization of data structures
used in Cardano’s Haskell implementation of Shelley along with useful
utility functions.


## How can you use this library

Rust is wonderfully portable! You can easily bind to the native Rust
library from any common programming language (even C and WebAssembly)!


### NPM packages
 
-  [NodeJS WASM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-nodejs)
-  [Browser (chrome/firefox) WASM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-browser)
-  [Browser (pure JS - no WASM) ASM.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-asmjs)


### Mobile bindings

-  [React-Native mobile bindings](https://github.com/Emurgo/react-native-haskell-shelley)

## Benefits of using this library

Serialization/deserialization code is automatically generated from
Cardano’s official specification, which guarantees it can easily stay up
to date! We do this using an EMURGO-written tool called [cddl-codegen](https://github.com/Emurgo/cddl-codegen)
which can be re-used for other tasks such as automatically generating a
Rust library for Cardano metadata specifications!

It is also very easy to create scripts in Rust or WASM to share with
stake pools, or even embed inside an online tool! No more crazy
cardano-cli bash scripts!

Powerful and flexible enough to be used to power wallets and exchanges!
(Yes, it’s used in production!)

## Documentation

This library generates both [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) type definitions,
so it’s often easiest to see what is possible by just looking at the
types! You can find the Flow types [here](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib/blob/master/rust/pkg/cardano_serialization_lib.js.flow).

You can also look in the [example](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib/tree/master/example) folder to see how to use this library from Typescript or just experiment with the library.

## What about other versions of Cardano?

If you are looking for legacy bindings, you can find them at the
following:

-  [Byron WASM bindings](https://github.com/input-output-hk/js-cardano-wasm/tree/master/cardano-wallet)
-  [Jormungandr WASM bindings](https://github.com/emurgo/js-chain-libs)

## Building

If you need to install Rust, do the following:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin/:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
rustup install stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
```   

To build this repository, do the following:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
nvm use
npm install
npm run rust:build-nodejs
```

## Testing

```shell
npm run rust:test
```

## Publishing

To publish a new version to [crates.io](https://crates.io)
```shell
npm run rust:publish
```


To publish new versions to NPM (only needed if you are an admin of this project)
```shell
npm run js:publish-nodejs
npm run js:publish-browser
npm run js:publish-asm
```
