### Overview

This guide will show you how to compile and install the `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your operating system of choice, directly from the source-code. It will enable you to interact with the **Cardano** blockchain, including but not limited to sending/receiving **transactions**, creating **NFTs**, posting transaction **metadata** into the blockchain, minting/burning **native tokens**, creating a **stake pool**, executing **smart contracts**, and so much more!

:::note
If you want to avoid compiling the binaries yourself, you can download the latest versions of `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` from the links below.

<HydraBuildList
    latest="7408469"
    linux="7408438"
    macos="7408630"
    win64="7408538"/>

The components can be built and run on **Windows** and **MacOS**, but we recommend that stake pool operators use **Linux** in production to take advantage of the associated performance advantages.
:::

### Prerequisites

To set up the components, you will need:

* **Windows**, **MacOS**, or **Linux** for your operating system
* A **CPU** with at least **two** cores
* **8GB** of RAM and at least **10GB** of free disk space

:::note
If intending to connect to mainnet instance, the requirements for RAM and storage would increase beyond baselines above.
:::

### Choose your Platform

* [Linux](#linux)
* [MacOS](#macos)
* [Windows](#windows)


## Linux

In this section, we will walk you through the process of downloading, compiling, and installing `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your **Linux-based** operating system. 

#### Installing Operating System dependencies

To download the source code and build it, you need the following packages and tools on your Linux system:

* the version control system `git`,
* the `gcc` C-compiler,
* C++ support for `gcc`,
* developer libraries for the arbitrary precision library `gmp`,
* developer libraries for the compression library `zlib`,
* developer libraries for `systemd`,
* developer libraries for `ncurses`,
* `ncurses` compatibility libraries,
* the Haskell build tool `cabal`,
* the GHC Haskell compiler (version `8.10.4` or above).

In Redhat, Fedora, and Centos:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install git gcc gcc-c++ tmux gmp-devel make tar xz wget zlib-devel libtool autoconf -y
sudo yum install systemd-devel ncurses-devel ncurses-compat-libs -y
```

For Debian/Ubuntu, use the following instead:
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install automake build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libtinfo-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev make g++ tmux git jq wget libncursesw5 libtool autoconf -y
```
If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to use the correct package manager for your platform instead of `yum` or `apt-get`, and the names of the packages you need to install might differ.

#### Installing GHC and Cabal

The fastest way to install **GHC** (Glassglow Haskell Compiler) and **Cabal** (Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries) is to use [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup).

Use the following command to install `ghcup`
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```
Please follow the instructions and provide the necessary input to the installer. Once complete, you should have `ghc` and `cabal` installed to your system.


:::note
`ghcup` will try to detect your shell and ask you to add it to the environment variables. Please restart your shell/terminal after installing `ghcup`
:::

You can check if `ghcup` has been installed correctly by typing `ghcup --version` into the terminal. You should see something similar to the following: 

```
The GHCup Haskell installer, version v0.1.14.1
```

`ghcup` will install the latest stable version of `ghc`. However, as of the time of writing this, [Input-Output](https://iohk.io) recommends using `ghc 8.10.4`. So, we will use `ghcup` to install and switch to the required version. 

```bash
ghcup install ghc 8.10.4
ghcup set ghc 8.10.4
```

`ghcup` will install the latest stable version of `cabal`. However, as of the time of writing this, [Input-Output](https://iohk.io) recommends using `cabal 3.4.0.0`. So, we will use `ghcup` to install and switch to the required version.

```bash
ghcup install cabal 3.4.0.0
ghcup set cabal 3.4.0.0
```


Finally, we check if we have the correct `ghc` and `cabal` versions installed.

Check `ghc` version: 
```bash
ghc --version
```

You should see something like this: 
```
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.4
```

Check `cabal` version: 
```bash
cabal --version
```

You should see something like this: 

```
cabal-install version 3.4.0.0
compiled using version 3.4.0.0 of the Cabal library
```

:::important
Please confirm that the versions you have installed match the recommended versions above. If not, check if you have missed any of the previous steps.

#### Downloading & Compiling

Let's create a working directory to store the source-code and builds for the components.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/cardano-src
cd $HOME/cardano-src
```
Next, we will download, compile and install `libsodium`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium
cd libsodium
git checkout 66f017f1
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Then we will add the following environment variables to your shell profile. E.G `$HOME/.zshrc` or `$HOME/.bashrc` depending on what shell application you are using. Add the following to the bottom of your shell profile/config file so that the compiler can be aware that `libsodium` is installed on your system.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```

Once saved, we will then reload your shell profile to use the new variables. We can do that by typing `source $HOME/.bashrc` or `source $HOME/.zshrc` (***depending on the shell application you use***).

Now we are ready to download, compile and install `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli`. But first, we have to make sure we are back at the root of our working directory:

```bash
cd $HOME/cardano-src
```

Download the `cardano-node` repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git
cd cardano-node
git fetch --all --recurse-submodules --tags
```
Switch the repository to the latest tagged commit: 

```bash
git checkout $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
```

:::important
If upgrading an existing node, please ensure that you have read the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases) for any changes.
:::

#### Configuring the build options

We explicitly use the `ghc` version that we installed earlier. This avoids defaulting to a system version of `ghc` that might be newer or older than the one you have installed.

```bash
cabal configure --with-compiler=ghc-8.10.4
```

#### Building and installing the node

We can now build the `Haskell-based` `cardano-node` to produce executable binaries.

```bash
cabal build cardano-node cardano-cli
```

Install the newly built node and CLI commands to the $HOME/.local/bin directory:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
cp -p "$(./scripts/bin-path.sh cardano-node)" $HOME/.local/bin/
cp -p "$(./scripts/bin-path.sh cardano-cli)" $HOME/.local/bin/
```

We have to add this line below our shell profile so that the shell/terminal can recognize that `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` are global commands. (`$HOME/.zshrc` or `$HOME/.bashrc` ***depending on the shell application you use***)

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/:$PATH"
```

Once saved, reload your shell profile by typing `source $HOME/.zshrc` or `source $HOME/.bashrc` (***depending on the shell application you use***).

Check the version that has been installed:
```
cardano-cli --version
cardano-node --version
```

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Cardano components into your Linux system! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Next, we will talk about how to [run cardano-node](running-cardano.md).

## MacOS

In this section, we will walk you through the process of downloading, compiling, and installing `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your **MacOS-based** operating system. 

:::note
Please note that this guide only supports [Intel-based Apple MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Intel_processors) hardware. [Apple Silicon (M1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) hardware guide is still in progress.
:::

#### Installing Operating System dependencies

To download the source code and build it, you need the following packages and tools on your MacOS system:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) - The Apple Development IDE and SDK/Tools
* [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/), you can install it by typing `xcode-select --install` in the terminal.
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - The Missing Package Manager for MacOS (or Linux)

#### Installing Homebrew packages

For the `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` components to compile properly, we will need to install some libraries via `brew`: 

```bash
brew install jq
brew install libtool
brew install autoconf
brew install automake
brew install pkg-config
```

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Cardano components into your MacOS system! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Next, we will talk about how to [run cardano-node](running-cardano.md).

## Windows

:::important
Currently, the **Windows** installation guide is still in progress. In the meantime, we recommend using [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) to get a Linux environment on top of Windows. Once installed, you can use the [Linux](#linux) guide to install and run `cardano-node` within **WSL**.
