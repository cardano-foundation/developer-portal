Blockfrost is a comprehensive infrastructure toolkit designed to assist developers in building projects on the Cardano platform.

At the heart of the ecosystem lies a user-friendly, swift, feature-rich and fine-tuned [API as a Service](https://blockfrost.io), providing seamless access to the Cardano blockchain and associated networks. The service is public and freely accessible, making it the perfect alternative to running and maintaining your own infrastructure and tools.

In addition to the Cardano networks, it also provides access to IPFS and Milkomeda.

The core technology of Blockfrost is [open-source](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-backend-ryo), and its development is supported by the collaborative efforts of the Cardano community.
