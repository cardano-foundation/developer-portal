## Introduction

AI agents on Cardano enable autonomous systems to interact directly with the blockchain. These agents can execute transactions, monitor on-chain events, and make decisions based on chain state without human intervention.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous software systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. When integrated with Cardano, these agents can interact with the blockchain to perform tasks like automated trading, portfolio management, governance participation, or smart contract interactions.

## Use Cases

AI agents on Cardano can be used for various applications. Automated trading bots can monitor market conditions and execute trades based on predefined strategies. Portfolio management agents can rebalance holdings and optimize returns. Governance agents can participate in on-chain voting based on analysis of proposals. DeFi automation agents can manage liquidity positions, harvest yields, or execute complex multi-step transactions.

## Getting Started

To integrate AI agents with Cardano, you'll need to handle wallet management, transaction building, and blockchain interaction. The following guides show different approaches and implementations for building AI agents on Cardano.
