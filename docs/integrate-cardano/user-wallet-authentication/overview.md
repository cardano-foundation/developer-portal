## Introduction

Wallet-based authentication allows users to prove ownership of their Cardano wallet by cryptographically signing a message. This provides a secure, password-free way to authenticate users on your application using their blockchain identity.

## How It Works

The authentication process uses message signing as described in [CIP-8](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0008) with [CIP-30](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0030)-compatible wallets:

1. **User connects wallet** - The application requests access to the user's wallet
2. **Backend generates nonce** - A unique random string is created for this authentication attempt
3. **User signs nonce** - The wallet prompts the user to sign the nonce with their private key
4. **Backend verifies signature** - The signature is cryptographically verified to prove wallet ownership

## Use Cases

Wallet-based authentication can be used for:

- **User sign-in** - Passwordless login using wallet ownership as identity
- **Whitelist verification** - Confirm users own specific wallet or stake addresses
- **Action authorization** - Verify user approval for off-chain actions (e.g., in-game trading)
- **Gated content** - Restrict access to holders of specific native tokens
- **Reward claims** - Authenticate wallet owners when claiming token rewards

## Key Concepts

### Staking Address as Identifier

The user's staking address (reward address) is used as their unique identifier. This address:

- Remains constant even if payment addresses change
- Uniquely identifies the wallet across the application
- Can be derived from any payment address in the wallet

### Nonce for Security

A **nonce** (number used once) is a random string generated by the backend that:

- Ensures each authentication attempt is unique
- Prevents replay attacks where an old signature is reused
- Must be rotated after each verification attempt

### Signature Verification

The cryptographic signature proves ownership because:

- Only the private key holder can create a valid signature
- The signature can be verified using the public key
- Any tampering with the message invalidates the signature

## Implementation Options

Some implementation options are covered by following libraries

### Mesh SDK (Recommended)

**Best for**: Most developers, rapid development, modern applications

The Mesh SDK provides high-level abstractions that handle the complexity:

- Simple `generateNonce()` and `checkSignature()` utilities
- Built-in wallet connection with React components
- Minimal code required (~50 lines)
- Easy to integrate and maintain

### Cardano Serialization Library

**Best for**: Advanced use cases, custom implementations, learning internals

The CSL approach gives you low-level control:

- Direct access to COSE signature parsing
- Manual public key verification
- Understanding of cryptographic internals
- Custom signature validation logic
