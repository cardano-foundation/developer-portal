### Overview 

In this guide, we will show you how to create a **Cardano** wallet, receive some `tAda` (**test ada**) in the `testnet` network and send basic example transactions. We will explore tools like `cardano-cli` and `cardano-wallet` on how they can help with these functionalities.

:::note
This guide assumes you have installed `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your system. If not you can refer to [Installing cardano-node](/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node) guide for instructions on how to do that.

You must also connect your `cardano-node` to the `testnet` network and make sure it is fully synchronized.

If you are not sure how to do that, It is recommended to read [Running cardano-node](/docs/get-started/running-cardano) guide before proceeding.
:::

### Cardano Wallets 

So you installed your `cardano-node` and got it running, you probably even tried to query some simple blockchain data (If you read [Running cardano-node](/docs/get-started/running-cardano) guide). But how do you actually create a **Cardano** wallet, receive and send some `ada` or `tAda` tokens?

First we have to look at the applications we can use to create wallets.

- [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) : **Daedalus Wallet** is the official **Cardano** full-node wallet, which is a [GUI (Graphical User Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) application for the Desktop (**Linux**, **MacOS**, **Windows**). That means that users will get to use a nice UI (User Interface), buttons and layout to interact with the **Cardano** blockchain.

    A full-node wallet basically means that it has to synchronize and download the blockchain first before users are able to send transactions and interact with the wallet.
    
    It is open-source mainly being developed by [InputOutputGlobal](https://iohk.io/), the development company behind the **Cardano** protocol and also one of the three foundational entities of the **Cardano** project.

- [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) : **Yoroi Wallet** is the official **Cardano** light-wallet, It is available as a **mobile application** and as a **browser extension**. 
  
  A light-wallet means that users will not be forced to download the entire blockchain, Instead **Yoroi** has a backend server and downloads the blockchain data for the user without the user exposing sensitive data(**Private Keys**) to the server and ultimately maintaining security. This achieves a faster experience for the user due to the fact the user will not have to wait for hours before being able to use the wallet.

  It is open-source mainly being developed by [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io), A company based in [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) which focuses on Business and Enterprise adoption of the **Cardano** blockchain. It is also one of the three foundational entities of the **Cardano** project.

- [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) : `cardano-wallet` is a [CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) application that provides **Cardano** wallet functionalities both via command-line parameters or via a [Web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API). 

 It is the wallet-backend that **Daedalus** wallet uses under-the-hood so it is also open-source, one of the many Haskell-based **Cardano** software components being written by [InputOutputGlobal](https://iohk.io/).

 You can find `cardano-wallet` **REST API** documentation here: [https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/)

- [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) : `cardano-cli` is also a [CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) application that provides **Cardano** wallet functionalities. But `cardano-cli` purpose is geared more towards general **Cardano** functionalities like generating **keys**, building and submitting **transactions**, managing **stake pools** certificates, simple blockchain queries like wallet address **UTXO** and more.

    It is part of the `cardano-node` project repository, so if you [compile and install](/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node) `cardano-node` you should also have `cardano-cli` as-well. It is one of the many Haskell-based **Cardano** software components being written by [InputOutputGlobal](https://iohk.io/).

:::warning
Always download the wallets from official sources. There are many fake wallets, malicious software pretending to be **Cardano** wallets that could potentially steal your tokens / assets.
:::

### Creating a wallet

As mentioned before, in this guide we will only be focusing on the `cardano-cli` and `cardano-wallet` since they provide some level of programmability which is important when we are talking about **Cardano** integrations for different kinds of use-cases.


#### Creating a wallet with `cardano-cli`

:::note
In this section, We will use the path `$HOME/cardano` to store all the `cardano-cli` related files as an example, please replace it with the directory you have choosen to store the files.
:::

:::important
Please make sure your `cardano-node` is connected and synchronized to the `testnet` network before proceeding.
:::

:::warning
In a production environment, it might not be a good idea to store wallets / keys in a public server unless you know what you are doing.
:::

First, lets create a directory to store all our `keys` like so:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/cardano/keys
```

Make sure we are inside the `keys` directory like so: `cd $HOME/cardano/keys`

Next, we generate our **payment key-pair** using `cardano-cli`:

```bash
cardano-cli address key-gen \
--verification-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.vkey \
--signing-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.skey
```

`cardano-cli address key-gen` : generates a **payment key-pair**.

`--verification-key-file` : points to the path where you want to save the `vkey` file.

`--signing-key-file` : points to the path where you want to save the `skey` file.

You should now have two files in your `keys` directory like so: 

```bash
$HOME/cardano/keys/
├── payment1.skey
└── payment1.vkey

0 directories, 2 files
```

Lets try to understand what these keys are used for in a very high-level overview that is relevant to our topic:

- `.vkey` / **Public Verification Key** : Is used to derive a **Cardano** wallet address, a wallet address is basically the hash string value that you share to other users to provide them a way to send `ada` / `tAda` or other assets in the **Cardano** blockchain into your wallet.

    **The verification key file should look something like this**:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "PaymentVerificationKeyShelley_ed25519",
        "description": "Payment Verification Key",
        "cborHex": "582056a29cba161c2a534adae32c4359fda6f90a3f6ae6990491237b28c1caeef0c4"
    }
    ```

- `.skey` / **Private Signing Key** : Is used to sign / approve transactions for your wallet. As you can imagine, it is very important to not expose this file to the public and must be kept secure.

    **The signing key file should look something like this**:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "PaymentSigningKeyShelley_ed25519",
        "description": "Payment Signing Key",
        "cborHex": "58208c61d557e1b8ddd82107fa506fab1b1565ec76fe96e8fb19a922d5460acd5a5b"
    }
    ```

Since we now have our **payment key-pair**, the next step would be to generate a **wallet address** for the `testnet` network like so:

```bash
cardano-cli address build \
--payment-verification-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.vkey \
--out-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr \
--testnet-magic 1097911063
```

- `cardano-cli address build` : Generates a **wallet address** from a `vkey` file.

- `--payment-verification-key-file` : The path to the `vkey` file to be used for the derivation.

- `--out-file` : The path to save the wallet address file.

- `--testnet-magic` : The **NetworkMagic** of the network that where you want to use the wallet address.

You should now have `payment1.vkey`, `payment1.skey` and `payment1.addr` in your `keys` directory. It should look something like this:

```bash
$HOME/cardano/keys/
├── payment1.addr
├── payment1.skey
└── payment1.vkey

0 directories, 3 files
```

The `payment1.addr` file contains the derived **wallet address** from your `vkey` file. It should look something like this:

```
addr_test1vz95zjvtwm9u9mc83uzsfj55tzwf99fgeyt3gmwm9gdw2xgwrvsa5
```

:::note
 You can derive more than one **wallet address** from a **Public Verification Key** for more advanced use-cases using `cardano-addresses` component. Which we discuss in more details here: ***@TODO: link to article***

  - `mainnet` addresses are **prefixed** with the string value `addr1`. 
  - `testnet` addresses are **prefixed** with the string value `addr_test1`. 


 If you want to create a wallet address to be used on `mainnet`, please use the `--mainnet` flag instead of `--testnet-magic 1097911063`. You can learn more about the different **Cardano** blockchain networks [here](/docs/get-started/running-cardano#mainnet--production).
:::

#### Querying the wallet **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)** with `cardano-cli`

Now that we have a **wallet address**, we can then query the **UTXO** of the address like so: 

```bash
cardano-cli query utxo \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 \
--address $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr)
```

- `cardano-cli query utxo` : Queries the wallet address **UTXO**.

- `--testnet-magic 1097911063` : Specifies that we want to query the `testnet` **Cardano** network.

- `--address $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr)` : The **wallet address** string value that we want to query, In this case we read the contents of `$HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr` using the `cat` command and we pass that value to the `--address` flag. That means you could also directly paste the **wallet address** value like so: 
```
--address addr_test1vz95zjvtwm9u9mc83uzsfj55tzwf99fgeyt3gmwm9gdw2xgwrvsa5
```

You should see something like this:

```
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


Now you might find it odd that there is not much information in the result that was returned the command, but that is totally normal as there are no available **UTXO** in the specific **wallet address** that we have queried just yet as it is a new wallet.

Our next step is to request some `tAda` from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](../integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet).

Once you requested some `tAda` from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](../integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet) we can then run the query again and you should see something like this:

```
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85     0        1000000000 lovelace
```

This result tells us that there is one **UTXO** with the amount of 1,000,000,000 `lovelaces` in our specific **wallet address**, that means our wallet has a balance of `1,000 tAda`. 

The result also specifies that the **UTXO** **transaction id** (`TxHash` / `TxId`) is `cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85` with the **transaction index** of `0`.

:::note
In the **Cardano** blockchain, the `lovelace` is the unit used to represent `ada` in **transactions** and **UTXO**. 

Where `1 ada` is equal to `1,000,000 lovelace`, so moving forward we will be using `lovelace` instead of `ada` / `tAda`.

You can also use the `TxHash` to view the complete transaction via the **Cardano Blockchain Explorer** for the relevant network. You can check the specific transaction for the example **UTXO** here: [f3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85](https://explorer.cardano-testnet.iohkdev.io/en/transaction?id=cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85)

To learn more about **UTXO (unspent transaction output)** and how transactions work for the **UTXO Model**, we recommend watching this lecture by [Dr. Lars Brünjes](https://iohk.io/en/team/lars-brunjes), Education Director at [InputOutputGlobal](https://iohk.io).

:::

#### Creating simple transactions

To have a clearer understanding of how sending transactions work using `cardano-cli`, first lets create another wallet like so:

**Generate payment key-pair**
```bash
cardano-cli address key-gen \
--verification-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.vkey \
--signing-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.skey 
```

**Generate wallet address**
```bash
cardano-cli address build \
--payment-verification-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.vkey \
--out-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.addr \
--testnet-magic 1097911063
```

Once complete you should have the following directory structure:

```bash
$HOME/cardano/keys
├── payment1.addr
├── payment1.skey
├── payment1.vkey
├── payment2.addr
├── payment2.skey
└── payment2.vkey

0 directories, 6 files
```

Querying the **UTXO** for the second wallet `payment2.addr` should give you a familiar result:

```bash
cardano-cli query utxo \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 \
--address $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.addr)
```

**UTXO Result**
```
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Again, this is to be expected as the `payment2.addr` wallet address and keys has just recently been generated. So we expect that no one has sent any `tAda` to this wallet yet.

In this example, we now have two wallets. We can call them `payment1` and `payment2`. Now remember that we requested some `tAda` from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](../integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet) for `payment1` wallet, and thats how we have the following:

`payment1` **wallet**: `1,000,000,000 lovelace`

```
UTXO
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85     0        1000000000 lovelace
```

`payment2` **wallet**: `0 lovelace`
```
UTXO
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Now let's say we want to send `250,000,000 lovelace` to `payment2` **wallet**, how can we achieve that?

We start by storing the current on-chain protocol parameters to a **JSON** file:

**Query Protocol Parameters**
```bash
cardano-cli query protocol-parameters \
  --testnet-magic 1097911063 \
  --out-file $HOME/cardano/protocol.json
```
This will produce a **JSON** file that looks something like this:
```json
{
    "poolDeposit": 500000000,
    "protocolVersion": {
        "minor": 0,
        "major": 4
    },
    "minUTxOValue": 1000000,
    "decentralisationParam": 0,
    "maxTxSize": 16384,
    "minPoolCost": 340000000,
    "minFeeA": 44,
    "maxBlockBodySize": 65536,
    "minFeeB": 155381,
    "eMax": 18,
    "extraEntropy": {
        "tag": "NeutralNonce"
    },
    "maxBlockHeaderSize": 1100,
    "keyDeposit": 2000000,
    "nOpt": 500,
    "rho": 3.0e-3,
    "tau": 0.2,
    "a0": 0.3
}
```


**Create draft transaction**

Next, we create a draft transaction like so:

```bash
cardano-cli transaction build-raw \
--tx-in cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85#0 \
--tx-out $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.addr)+0 \
--tx-out $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr)+0 \
--fee 0 \
--out-file $HOME/cardano/tx.draft
```

`cardano-cli transaction build-raw` : This tells `cardano-cli` to build a raw transaction.

`--tx-in` : This specifices the **UTXO** input that the transaction will use, you can add as many **UTXO** input as you want by adding multiple `--tx-in` in the `cardano-cli` arguments as long as they have a unique `TxHash` and `TxIdx` within all your inputs.

`--tx-out` : This specifies the target **wallet address**, **assets** and **quantity** to be sent to. You can add as many **UTXO** outputs as you want as long as the total **UTXO** input can satisfy the **assets** and **quantity** specified by the output.

`--fee` : This specifies the fee amount of the transaction in `lovelace`.

`--out-file` : This is the path to the transaction file that will be generated.

In this case, we are just building a draft transaction to calculate how much fee would the transaction need. We can do that by executing the following command: 

```bash
cardano-cli transaction calculate-min-fee \
--tx-body-file $HOME/cardano/tx.draft \
--tx-in-count 1 \
--tx-out-count 2 \
--witness-count 1 \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 \
--protocol-params-file $HOME/cardano/protocol.json
```

You should see something like this for the output: 

```bash
174169 Lovelace
```

You will notice that we use the `protocol.json` we queried awhile ago to calculate the transaction fee:
```
--protocol-params-file $HOME/cardano/protocol.json
```

That is because the transaction fee calculation results changes depending on the on-chain protocol parameters.

The `--witness-count 1` basically tells `cardano-cli` that there will be only `1` **signing key** required for this transaction to be valid. Since the **UTXO** input involved in this transaction will only be coming from `payment1` wallet, so that means we indeed only need `1` key to sign the transaction.

We can then finally build the real transaction like so:

```bash
cardano-cli transaction build-raw \
--tx-in cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85#0 \
--tx-out $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.addr)+250000000 \
--tx-out $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr)+749825831 \
--fee 174169 \
--out-file $HOME/cardano/tx.draft
```

To recap, We want to send `250,000,000 lovelace` from `payment1` wallet to `payment2` wallet. Our `payment1` wallet had the following **UTXO**:

```
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85     0        1000000000 lovelace
```

So we will use the `TxHash` `cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85` and `TxIx` `0` as our `--tx-input`. 

```bash
--tx-in cf3cf4850c8862f2d698b2ece926578b3815795c9e38d2f907280f02f577cf85#0
```

We then tell `cardano-cli` that the destination of the `250,000,000 lovelace` is the **wallet address** of `payment2`.

```bash
--tx-out $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.addr)+250000000
```

Now, we still have `750000000 lovelace` as the change amount, so we will simply send it back to ourselves like so:

```bash
--tx-out $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr)+749825831
```

Now an important question you might ask here is that, why is the amount `749825831 lovelace`? Well remember that we calculated the fee to be `174169 lovelace` and someone has to shoulder the transaction fee, so we decide that `payment` should pay for the fee with the change `lovelace` amount. So we calculate that `750000000 - 174169 = 749825831` and so the total change would be `749825831 lovelace`.

We then specify the transaction fee like so:

```
--fee 174169
```

And then we specify where we will save the transaction file:

```
--out-file $HOME/cardano/tx.draft
```

Now that we have the transaction file, we must sign the transaction in-order to prove that we are the owner of the input **UTXO** that was used.

```bash
cardano-cli transaction sign \
--tx-body-file $HOME/cardano/tx.draft \
--signing-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.skey \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 \
--out-file $HOME/cardano/tx.signed
```

`--signing-key-file $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.skey` : This argument tells the `cardano-cli` that we will use `payment1.skey` to sign the transaction.

Finally, we submit the transaction to the blockchain!

```bash
cardano-cli transaction submit \
--tx-file $HOME/cardano/tx.signed \
--testnet-magic 1097911063 
```
:::important
If you have waited too long to sign and submit the transaction, the fees might've changed during that time and therefore the transaction might get rejected by the network. To solve this, you simply have to **recalculate the fees, rebuild the transaction, sign it and submit it**!
:::

Checking the balances of both wallets `payment1` and `payment2`:

```bash
# payment1 wallet UTXO
❯ cardano-cli query utxo --testnet-magic 1097911063 --address $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment1.addr)

                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63eeeb7e43171aeea0b3d53c5a36236cf9af92d5ee39e99bfadfe0237c46bd91     1        749825303 lovelace

# payment2 wallet UTXO
❯ cardano-cli query utxo --testnet-magic 1097911063 --address $(cat $HOME/cardano/keys/payment2.addr)
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63eeeb7e43171aeea0b3d53c5a36236cf9af92d5ee39e99bfadfe0237c46bd91     0        250000000 lovelace
```

As we can see, `payment2` now has a **UTXO** with the amount of `250,000,000 lovelace` with the change amount returned to `payment1` and has generated a new **UTXO** with the amount of `749,825,303 lovelace` as-well.

Congratulations, You have created and sent your first **Cardano** transaction using `cardano-cli`! 🎉🎉🎉

#### Creating a wallet with `cardano-wallet`

:::note
This guide assumes you have installed `cardano-wallet` into your system. If not you can refer to [Installing cardano-wallet](/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-wallet) guide for instructions on how to do that.

We will use the path `$HOME/cardano/wallets` to store all the `cardano-wallet` related files as an example, please replace it with the directory you have choosen to store the files.
:::

:::important
Please make sure your `cardano-node` is connected and synchronized to the `testnet` network before proceeding.
:::

:::warning
In a production environment, it might not be a good idea to store wallets / keys in a public server unless you know what you are doing.
:::

First, lets create a directory to store all our `wallets` like so:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/cardano/wallets

**Starting cardano-wallet as a REST API server**

We will be focusing on the [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that `cardano-wallet` provides. In-order to interact with the API, we must first start the server.

```bash
cardano-wallet serve \
--port 1337 \
--testnet $HOME/cardano/testnet-byron-genesis.json \
--database $HOME/cardano/wallets/db \
--node-socket $CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH
```

`cardano-wallet serve` : Runs `cardano-wallet` as a web server that provides a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

`--port` : Specifies the port that the web server will listen to for any requests.

> You can choose whatever `port` number you like, but it is recommended to use `port` numbers `1024` and above. See [Registered Port](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/registered-port) for more information.

`--testnet` : Specifies the **Byron** genesis file path for the `testnet` network.

> This should match the genesis file that the `cardano-node` you are connected is using as-well. If you meant to connect to `mainnet` then use the `--mainnet` flag and the `mainnet` **Byron** genesis file instead.

`--database` : Specifies the path where the wallet database will be saved.

> It is important to note that the wallet creation function requires a passphrase so all the wallet data will be encrypted by the passphrase.

`--node-socket` : Specifies the `cardano-node` socket path that will be used by the `cardano-wallet` to communicate with the node.

> The `cardano-node` uses **IPC (Inter-Process-Communication)** for communicating with the other **Cardano** components like `cardano-cli`, `cardano-wallet` and `cardano-db-sync`. In **Linux** and **MacOS** it uses something called [unix sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) and [Named Pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes) in **Windows**.
> 
> Here is an example `--socket-path` argument for **Linux**:
```
--socket-path $HOME/cardano/db/node.socket
```
> As you can see the argument points to a file since **unix sockets** are represented as files (like everything else in **Linux**). In this case we put the socket file in the `db` directory that we have just created before.
> 
> In **Windows**, the `--socket-path` argument would look something like this:
```
--socket-path "\\\\.\\pipe\\cardano-node-testnet"
```
> As you notice its almost like a network `URI` or a network `Path` than a file, this is a key difference that you will have to be aware depending on your operating system. You can replace the string `cardano-node-testnet` in the argument to whatever you like, this example path in particular is used in the [Daedalus Testnet Wallet](https://daedaluswallet.io) for **Windows**.

Once the server is running you should see sometihng like this (among other things): 

```

[cardano-wallet.main:Info:4] [2021-06-03 13:48:24.86 UTC] Wallet backend server listening on http://127.0.0.1:1337/
```

**Checking Wallet Server Information**

The first thing we can do to test if the wallet server is working correctly is to query the network information via the API.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/network/information | jq
```

The result should be something like this: 

```json
{
  "node_era": "mary",
  "network_tip": {
    "slot_number": 408744,
    "absolute_slot_number": 28359144,
    "time": "2021-06-03T13:52:40Z",
    "epoch_number": 135
  },
  "next_epoch": {
    "epoch_start_time": "2021-06-03T20:20:16Z",
    "epoch_number": 136
  },
  "sync_progress": {
    "status": "ready"
  },
  "node_tip": {
    "height": {
      "unit": "block",
      "quantity": 2639489
    },
    "slot_number": 408722,
    "absolute_slot_number": 28359122,
    "time": "2021-06-03T13:52:18Z",
    "epoch_number": 135
  }
}
```

It is important to make sure that the `sync_progress.status` is equal to `ready` before proceeding.

**Creating the wallet**

To create a wallet we must first generate a wallet **recovery phrase** using the `cardano-wallet` in the CLI.

```bash
cardano-wallet recovery-phrase generate
```

You should get a **24-word mnemonic seed** in return similar to this: 

```
kit soup various toe cloud humor clip radio medal ladder casino sock various distance staff analyst success trade deal split leaf away pair camp
```

We can now create a **Cardano** wallet using the `/v2/wallets` API endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"name": "test_cf_1",
	"mnemonic_sentence": ["shift", "badge", "heavy", "action", "tube", "divide", "course", "quality", "capable", "velvet", "cart", "marriage", "vague", "aware", "maximum", "exist", "crime", "file", "analyst", "great", "cabbage", "course", "sad", "apology"],
	"passphrase": "test123456"
}' | jq
```

Our requests payload data looks like this:

```json
{
	"name": "test2",
	"mnemonic_sentence": ["kit", "soup", "various", "toe", "cloud", "humor", "clip", "radio", "medal", "ladder", "casino", "sock", "various", "distance", "staff", "analyst", "success", "trade", "deal", "split", "leaf", "away", "pair", "camp"],
	"passphrase": "test123456"
}
```

`name` : The name of the wallet.

`passphrase` : Sets the security phrase to protect the funds inside the wallet. It will be required everytime you need write access to the wallet, more specifically sending assets.

`mnemonic_sentence` : This is the wallet **recovery phrase** formatted into a `JSON` array.

If succesful, you should see something like this: 

```json
{
  "address_pool_gap": 20,
  "passphrase": {
    "last_updated_at": "2021-06-03T14:25:18.2676524Z"
  },
  "balance": {
    "available": {
      "unit": "lovelace",
      "quantity": 0
    },
    "total": {
      "unit": "lovelace",
      "quantity": 0
    },
    "reward": {
      "unit": "lovelace",
      "quantity": 0
    }
  },
  "id": "5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce",
  "state": {
    "status": "syncing",
    "progress": {
      "unit": "percent",
      "quantity": 0
    }
  },
  "name": "test_cf_1",
  "assets": {
    "available": [],
    "total": []
  },
  "tip": {
    "height": {
      "unit": "block",
      "quantity": 0
    },
    "slot_number": 0,
    "absolute_slot_number": 0,
    "time": "2019-07-24T20:20:16Z",
    "epoch_number": 0
  },
  "delegation": {
    "next": [],
    "active": {
      "status": "not_delegating"
    }
  }
}
```

Initially, the newly created/restored wallet will need to be synced before it can be used. You can verify if the wallet is already synced by executing the following request:

```bash
curl --request GET   --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/c4d4e240d499cce3fed8fd885491803885fdf323 | jq '.state'
```

***It is important to note that the `c4d4e240d499cce3fed8fd885491803885fdf323` string is actually the `wallet.id` of the previously generated wallet.***

You should see something like this:

```json
{
  "status": "ready"
}
```

**Receiving tAda (test ada)**

Now that we have created a wallet, we can now request some tAda from the **Testnet Faucet**. But before we can do that we must first get a cardano address for our wallet.

We can do that by executing the command:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce/addresses?state=unused' | jq '.[0]'
```

The result should be something like this:

```json
{
  "derivation_path": [
    "1852H",
    "1815H",
    "0H",
    "0",
    "0"
  ],
  "id": "addr_test1qzf9q3qjcaf6kxshwjfw9ge29njtm56r2a08g49l79xgt4je0592agqpwraqajx2dsu2sxj64uese5s4qum293wuc00q7j6vsp",
  "state": "unused"
}
```
It is important to note that the parameter of this request is the **wallet id** of the target wallet you want to get the address. In this case it is `5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce` our previously generated wallet.

We are basically querying the first wallet address that has not been used just yet, Indicated by `state: "unused"`. As we can see the wallet address value is: `addr_test1qpnjt8umuwr5f2y59avklhu8hd7h2uf4zfanxxr4nmqqsaw679hxgdmrtsjequ8ka27rm8366e6p7au9y89h6slmrjwskfmcef`

Now we can finally request some `tAda` for the wallet address from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](../integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet).

Once you requested some `tAda` from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](../integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet), we can then check if it has arrived into our wallet like so:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce | jq '.balance'
```

You should see something like this:

```json
{
  "available": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 1000000000
  },
  "total": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 1000000000
  },
  "reward": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 0
  }
}
```

As we can see here we have a total of `1,000,000,000 lovelace` available to spend that we received from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](../integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet).

#### Creating simple transactions

To have a clearer understanding of how sending transactions work using `cardano-wallet`, first lets create another wallet like so:

**Generate recovery-phrase**

```bash
cardano-wallet recovery-phrase generate
```
**Recovery-phrase result**

```
then tattoo copy glance silk kitchen kingdom pioneer off path connect artwork alley smooth also foil glare trouble erupt move position merge scale echo
```
**Create Wallet Request**
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"name": "test_cf_2",
	"mnemonic_sentence": ["then", "tattoo", "copy", "glance", "silk", "kitchen", "kingdom", "pioneer", "off", "path", "connect", "artwork", "alley", "smooth", "also", "foil", "glare", "trouble", "erupt", "move", "position", "merge", "scale", "echo"],
	"passphrase": "test123456"
}' | jq
```

**Create Wallet Result**

```json
{
  "address_pool_gap": 20,
  "passphrase": {
    "last_updated_at": "2021-06-04T11:39:06.8887923Z"
  },
  "balance": {
    "available": {
      "unit": "lovelace",
      "quantity": 0
    },
    "total": {
      "unit": "lovelace",
      "quantity": 0
    },
    "reward": {
      "unit": "lovelace",
      "quantity": 0
    }
  },
  "id": "4a64b453ad1c1d33bfec4d3ba90bd2456ede35bb",
  "state": {
    "status": "syncing",
    "progress": {
      "unit": "percent",
      "quantity": 0
    }
  },
  "name": "test_cf_2",
  "assets": {
    "available": [],
    "total": []
  },
  "tip": {
    "height": {
      "unit": "block",
      "quantity": 0
    },
    "slot_number": 0,
    "absolute_slot_number": 0,
    "time": "2019-07-24T20:20:16Z",
    "epoch_number": 0
  },
  "delegation": {
    "next": [],
    "active": {
      "status": "not_delegating"
    }
  }
}
```

We now have the following wallets:

| WalletId                                        | Wallet Name       | Balance(Lovelace)     |
| --------                                        | ---------         | ----------            |
| 5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce        | test_cf_1         | 1000000000            |
| 4a64b453ad1c1d33bfec4d3ba90bd2456ede35bb        | test_cf_2         | 0                     | 

Now let's say that we want to send `250,000,000 lovelaces` to `test_cf_2` wallet. Well first we have to get `test_cf_2` wallet address like so:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/4a64b453ad1c1d33bfec4d3ba90bd2456ede35bb/addresses?state=unused' | jq '.[0]'
```

and we should see something like this:

```json
{
  "derivation_path": [
    "1852H",
    "1815H",
    "0H",
    "0",
    "0"
  ],
  "id": "addr_test1qzyfnjk3zmgzmvnnvnpeguv6se2ptjj3w3uuh30llqe5xdtzdduxxvke8rekwukyn0qt9g5pahasrnrdmv7nr86x537qxdgza0",
  "state": "unused"
}
```

So now that we have `test_cf_2` wallet address `addr_test1qzyfnjk3zmgzmvnnvnpeguv6se2ptjj3w3uuh30llqe5xdtzdduxxvke8rekwukyn0qt9g5pahasrnrdmv7nr86x537qxdgza0`. We can now use it to send some `tAda` to it from `test_cf_1` wallet like so:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce/transactions \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"passphrase": "test123456",
	"payments": [
		{
			"address": "addr_test1qzyfnjk3zmgzmvnnvnpeguv6se2ptjj3w3uuh30llqe5xdtzdduxxvke8rekwukyn0qt9g5pahasrnrdmv7nr86x537qxdgza0",
			"amount": {
				"quantity": 250000000,
				"unit": "lovelace"
			}
		}
	]
}'
```

:::note
Remember, we use the `test_cf_1` wallet id in the `http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/<walletId>` endpoint, because we want the `test_cf_1` to send to `test_cf_2` wallet address.
:::

Now we can check `test_cf_2` wallet balance like so:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/4a64b453ad1c1d33bfec4d3ba90bd2456ede35bb | jq '.balance'
```

And we should see that indeed the `250,000,000 tAda` has been received (***you might need to wait for a few seconds***).

```json
{
  "available": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 250000000
  },
  "total": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 250000000
  },
  "reward": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 0
  }
}
```

Checking `test_cf_1` wallet balance should show you something like this:

```json
{
  "available": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 749831199
  },
  "total": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 749831199
  },
  "reward": {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": 0
  }
}
```

Our wallets should now be the following:

| WalletId                                        | Wallet Name       | Balance(Lovelace)     |
| --------                                        | ---------         | ----------            |
| 5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce        | test_cf_1         | 749831199             |
| 4a64b453ad1c1d33bfec4d3ba90bd2456ede35bb        | test_cf_2         | 250000000             |


:::note

It is important to note that `cardano-wallet` has automatically determined the fee for the transaction to send `250,000,000 lovelace` from wallet `test_cf_1` to `test_cf_2` and `cardano_wallet` has deducted the fee from `test_cf_1` wallet automatically.
