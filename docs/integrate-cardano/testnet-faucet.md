The testnet faucet is a service that provides test ada (tAda) to users of the Cardano testnet. These tokens have no value, but they enable users to experiment with Cardano testnet features without spending real ada on the mainnet. You can use test ada to [mint native tokens](../native-tokens/minting), to [play around with Cardano wallets](creating-wallet-faucet) or to [learn how to operate a stake pool](../operate-a-stake-pool/).

## Testnets faucet

2. Define your action. Select `Receive test ADA` in this case. You can also ask for `pool delegation` if you are managing a pool (learn [more](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/)).
3. Enter the address of the account where you want to top up funds.
4. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any additional funds you may have been allocated.
5. Confirm the `I'm not a robot` box and solve the captcha if needed.
6. Click on `Request` and the funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes. Use the [Cardano testnet explorer](https://explorer.cardano-testnet.iohkdev.io/) in case you want to check any transactions on the Cardano testnet.
