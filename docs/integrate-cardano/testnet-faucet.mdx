The Testnet Faucet is a service that provides test ada (tAda) to users of the Cardano testnets. These tokens have no value, but they enable users to experiment with Cardano testnet features without spending real ada on the Mainnet. You can use test ada to [mint native tokens](../native-tokens/minting), to [play around with Cardano wallets](creating-wallet-faucet) or to [learn how to operate a stake pool](../operate-a-stake-pool/).

## Testnets faucet

This portal allows you to send test ada to your wallet. You can access it [here](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet).

## How to get test ada 
1. Define your environment. You can get tada for either the `preview` or `preprod` testnets.
2. Define your action. Select `Receive test ADA` in this case. You can also ask for `pool delegation` if you are managing a pool (learn [more](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/)).
3. Enter the address of the account where you want to top up funds.
4. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any additional funds you may have been allocated.
5. Confirm the `I'm not a robot` box and solve the captcha if needed.
6. Click on `Request` and the funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes. Use the [Cardano PreProd Testnet Explorer](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/) and [Cardano PreView Testnet Explorer](https://preview.cardanoscan.io/) provided by Cardanoscan.io in case you want to check any transactions on a Cardano testnet.
