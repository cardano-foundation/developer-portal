**Welcome**, we are glad that you are interested in setting up a stake pool on Cardano.

This course is designed to (re)introduce you to Cardano, walk you through how to set up a stake pool, and provide guidance on managing and maintaining your stake pool to ensure optimal performance and profitability.

:::danger Testnet only
The whole stake pool course is only on the testnet. Before you run your pool on the mainnet, you should have practised a lot on the testnet, know how to rotate your KES keys and have great understanding of stake pool security.
