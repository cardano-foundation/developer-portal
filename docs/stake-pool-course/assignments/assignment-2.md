:::note
As explained before, core and relay nodes must run in separate machines. In
this assignment you will create a second server or Virtual Machine to host
your core node.
:::note

Complete the following tasks in a second server:

1. Create a second server on AWS or Virtual Machine in Virtual Box. This one will host your core node and hold your stake pool keys.
2. Install dependencies
3. Install cabal
4. Install GHC
5. Install libsodium
6. Create the directory .local/bin and add it to the PATH
7. Build the node from source in your new server or Virtual Machine.
8. Get Configuration files

Repeat what you learned on [Lesson 1](../lesson-1#install-cardano-node)


:::note
DO NOT START YOUR CORE NODE YET.
When you have completed tasks 1-8, continue to [KES-Periods](../assignments/kes_period)
