In order to build a node from source, run it and connect it to the Cardano mainnet, you need a Linux system with at least 4GB RAM and 24GB hard drive space. The RAM is mostly needed for _building_ the node; for _running_ it, 1GB would be sufficient. The hard drive space is necessary if you want to connect to and download the Cardano blockchain.

You can use VirtualBox to learn how to set up stake pool.
