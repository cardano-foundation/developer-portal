In this course, we use the **Cardano TESTNET**, so let's get the configuration files for it.

:::note
Do not use MAINNET during taking this course
:::

Starting the node and connecting it to the testnet requires 4 configuration files:

* topology.json
* BYRON genesis.json
* SHELLEY genesis.json
* config.json

In your home directory, create a new directory for the configuration files:

```sh
cd
mkdir relay
cd relay
```

Now download the latest testnet configuration files:

```sh
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-config.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-shelley-genesis.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-byron-genesis.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-topology.json
```
