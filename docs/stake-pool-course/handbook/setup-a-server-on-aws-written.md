If you do not have access to a computer running Linux \(or VirtualBox\), you can use Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) to create a cloud-based virtual machine running Linux for free. To do so, please follow the steps below:

* Go to [Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create a \(free\) account if you do not have one already.
* Go to the _AWS Management Console_.
* Go to the _EC2 Dashboard_.

* If you already have a running instance, go to step 9.
* We must first make sure to get enough harddrive space \(at least 24GB\). Click on _Volumes_.

* Under _Actions_, select _Modify Volume_.
