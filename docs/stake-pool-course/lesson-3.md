## Create Stake Pool Keys and Addresses

In the post-Shelley era of Cardano, every stakeholder can have two sets of keys and addresses:

* Payment keys and addresses: To send and receive transactions
* Stake keys and addresses: To control protocol participation, create a stake pool, delegate and receive rewards.

Learn how to create those keys and addresses. To be able to follow the video better you can find the written tutorial [how to create Payment and Stake keys](handbook/create-stake-pool-keys) in the stake pool operator handbook.
