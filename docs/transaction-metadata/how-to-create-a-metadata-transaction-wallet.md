:::note
This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of `cardano-wallet` and `cardano-cli`, how to use it and that you have installed it into your system. Otherwise, we recommend reading [Installing cardano-node](../get-started/installing-cardano-node), [Running cardano-node](../get-started/running-cardano), and [Exploring Cardano Wallets](../integrate-cardano/creating-wallet-faucet) guides first.

This guide also assumes that you have `cardano-node` and `cardano-wallet` running in the background and connected to the `testnet` network.

## Overview 

This article will explore how we can utilize the **Transaction Metadata** feature of the **Cardano** blockchain. More specifically, how we can insert and retrieve metadata that we have stored in the blockchain for a decentralized application using **Transaction Metadata**.

## Use case

Let's imagine a decentralized **To-Do List Application** that stores and retrieve its metadata not from centralized servers or storage but instead from the **Cardano blockchain**. First, let's check the diagram below to see how something like this could theoretically work:

![img](../../static/img/tx-meta-data/todo-list-app.png)

:::important
The diagram is heavily simplified and is not recommended to deploy in production.
:::

We see here that there is a **front-end** application the user interacts with and is responsible for inserting and retrieving the metadata to/from the **back-end** server. The **back-end** server is responsible for communicating to the `cardano-node` by creating **transactions** and querying the blockchain for the **metadata** information required by the **front-end**.

The **front-end** application is not necessarily tied to the specific **back-end** API and could switch to another API as long as it ultimately communicates to the **Cardano** network.

How do you actually create **transaction metadata** in the **Cardano** blockchain, you ask? We'll let's get our hands dirty!

## Setup

To create a transaction metadata using the `cardano-wallet`, you must first create a wallet if you haven't already.

** Generate mnemonic seed **

```bash
cardano-wallet recovery-phrase generate
```

** Create Wallet with the generated mnemonic seed **

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name": "test_cf_1",
    "mnemonic_sentence": ["shift", "badge", "heavy", "action", "tube", "divide", "course", "quality", "capable", "velvet", "cart", "marriage", "vague", "aware", "maximum", "exist", "crime", "file", "analyst", "great", "cabbage", "course", "sad", "apology"],
    "passphrase": "test123456"
}' | jq
```

Now that you have a wallet, we can now retrieve a **wallet address**:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce/addresses?state=unused' | jq '.[0]["id"]'
```

Now that you have a **wallet address**, you can now request for some `tAda` funds from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://developers.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet).

Once you have some funds, we can now create the sample metadata that we want to store into the blockchain.

Now let's say that the `JSON` shape we decided on for our **To-Do List** application is the following:

```json
{
    "1337": {
        "name": "hello world",
        "completed": 0
    }
}
```

:::note

Based on our theoretical **To-Do List** application, this `JSON` shape could be a way to insert / update entries into our list. We choose an arbitrary number (`1337`) as the key, and we are basically saying that all metadata that will be inserted with that key is related to the **To-Do List** application data. Although we don't have control over what will be inserted with that metadata key since **Cardano** is an open platform.

:::

Now that we have our `JSON` data, we can create a transaction and embed the metadata into the transaction. Ultimately storing it into the **Cardano** blockchain forever.

## JSON Format

`cardano-wallet` has special requirements in terms of the `JSON` format of the payload that it accepts. Here are some examples: 

```json
{
    "0": {
        "string": "cardano"
    },
    "1": {
        "int": 14
    },
    "2": {
        "bytes": "2512a00e9653fe49a44a5886202e24d77eeb998f"
    },
    "3": {
        "list": [
            {
                "int": 14
            }
        ]
    },
    "4": {
        "map": [
            {
                "k": {
                    "string": "key"
                },
                "v": {
                    "string": "value"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

So we will have to convert our `JSON` metadata payload to the format the `cardano-wallet` accepts:

```json
{
    "1337": {
        "map": [
            {
                "k": {
                    "string": "name"
                },
                "v": {
                    "string": "hello world"
                }
            },
            {
                "k": {
                    "string": "completed"
                },
                "v": {
                    "int": 0
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Submit to blockchain

Once we have the accepted format, we can now finally submit the metadata to the blockchain.

First, let's retrieve another **unused wallet address** from our wallet: 

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce/addresses?state=unused' | jq '.[0]["id"]'
```

Now we will send `1,000,000 lovelace` to our own wallet while attaching the metadata in the transaction, ultimately storing it into the blockchain forever.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:1337/v2/wallets/5076b34c6949dbd150eb9c39039037543946bdce/transactions \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "passphrase": "test123456",
    "payments": [
        {
            "address": "addr_test1qpg2eglv9gf2rksvdj53t6ajfgzkycaadlt2fatjyn4etpze0592agqpwraqajx2dsu2sxj64uese5s4qum293wuc00q6hnhqq",
            "amount": {
                "quantity": 1000000,
                "unit": "lovelace"
            }
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "1337": {
            "map": [
                {
                    "k": {
                        "string": "name"
                    },
                    "v": {
                        "string": "hello world"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "k": {
                        "string": "completed"
                    },
                    "v": {
                        "int": 0
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}'
```

Congratulations, you are now able to submit **Cardano** transactions with metadata embedded into them. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Up next, we discuss how to retrieve metadata that we have stored in the **Cardano** blockchain. **@TODO**
