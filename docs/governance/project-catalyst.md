Visit the official [Project Catalyst website](https://projectcatalyst.io/) for a comprehensive overview of the services and solutions provided by the world's largest decentralized innovation engine for solving real-world challenges.

The portal on [cardano.ideascale.com](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) is where the Cardano community’s ideas come to life. Here, users can browse active campaigns, participate in discussions, and put forward their ideas for feedback and voting from the community.

Built around ‘Active Campaigns’, the Project Catalyst Ideascale contains several categories of proposals that idea-makers and entrepreneurs can explore when making a proposal. These include classes like ‘DApps and Integrations’, ‘Local Community Centers’, ‘Developer Ecosystem’ proposals, and more. There are separate funds available for each category, and some classes already have well over 100 active proposals.

Within each active campaign, you can find a campaign brief. This is a short explainer of what proposals should include, how to meet the campaign's requirements and some guiding questions for proposals. You will also find a stage flow that guides you through the timeline of each campaign.

Discover a wealth of community-generated proposals by visiting one of the [idea explorers](#browse-funded-ideas) listed below. Explore existing proposals to gain valuable insights into what makes a successful proposal and how to position your submission for maximum impact. Whether you're considering submitting an idea or simply looking to engage with the community, this is the place to start.

## Alternative funding options

[Project Catalyst](project-catalyst) should be your tool of choice when it comes to project funding on Cardano. For the sake of completeness, here is a place to list alternative funding options for your project.

### The cFund

The [cFund](https://cfund.vc/) is a venture fund that manages all centralized fund operations secured by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) and [Wave Financial](https://wavegp.com/) where each of them participated with 10$ million to back ambitious founders globally. 

The [cFund](https://cfund.vc/) is a homage to Apple's iFund that was introduced in 2008 to bootstrap iOS development. Compared to Project Catalyst, the funds available here are relatively small.

The **cFund** started in July 2020 with the goals to achieve:
* Growing the Cardano ecosystem.
* Working with governments, especially in developing countries in Africa and South America.
* Providing access to high-speed, adaptable financing for founders to manage payment flows and invest in the Cardano ecosystem.

The first **cFund** investment took place In April 2021. It provided $500,000 to innovative enterprise-grade fintech technology called [COTI, the currency of the internet](https://coti.io/). **COTI** secured the investment to support stakeholder-driven payment solutions and enables them to pack digitally any currency.
