A Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) is a formalized design document for the Cardano community, providing information or describing a new feature for the Cardano network, its processes, or environment in a concise and technically sufficient manner. We describe what a CIP is, how the CIP process functions, and how users should propose, discuss, and structure a CIP [in the very first CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0001/CIP-0001.md).

The Cardano Foundation intends CIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting design decisions that have gone into Cardano. Because the CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.
