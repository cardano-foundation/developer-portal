![Cardano Governance](../../static/img/card-governance-title.svg)

Cardano has been meticulously designed to ensure sustainability and longevity. A cornerstone of this vision is its self-sufficient governance and funding model, which eliminates the need for external funding. At the heart of Cardano's innovative approach is an on-chain treasury system, consistently funded each epoch by a fixed percentage of the virtual pot, which encompasses all transaction fees collected within that epoch and the ada allocated from the reserve, with the reserve's ada allocation determined by the monetary expansion rate. These mechanisms are pivotal for the platform's ongoing development. They are detailed in discussions with [Bingsheng Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyh3h_yX-S0), providing valuable insights into the treasury's operations.

## Cardano Protocol Governance

Cardano is embarking on a transformative journey towards decentralized governance with the introduction of [CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694), marking the onset of the [Voltaire era](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/). This proposal establishes a governance framework comprising three roles: the already established group of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and two novel roles consisting of a Constitutional Committee (CC) and Delegated Representatives (DReps). Community participation is at the core of this governance model, allowing every ada holder to engage in the decision-making process directly. Through CIP-1694, the governance model evolves to encourage a more inclusive and community-driven approach, reflecting Cardano's commitment to sustainable growth and innovation.

## Cardano Improvement Proposals and Cardano Problem Statements

[Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)](https://cips.cardano.org/) and [Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs)](https://cips.cardano.org/?type=cps) are essential to the ecosystem's evolution, facilitating structured innovation and addressing challenges within the network. CIPs serve as a formal process for proposing enhancements or standards for the Cardano protocol, offering a clear pathway for community engagement and technical refinement. Anybody willing to do the work can introduce ideas, which are then collaboratively refined through community input and with the help of the [CIP editors](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0001#editors), ensuring proposals are robust and beneficial before implementation.

The CPS process, outlined in [CIP-9999](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-9999), complements this by focusing on identifying and articulating specific issues or areas for improvement within Cardano, allowing for a targeted approach to problem-solving. CIPs and CPSs reflect Cardano's dedication to continuous development and community-driven standards, ensuring adaptability and responsiveness to user needs.

## Empowering Innovation with Project Catalyst

[Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) is described as "the world's largest decentralized innovation engine," aimed at solving real-world challenges through community-driven proposals within the Cardano ecosystem. Members of the Cardano community propose, evaluate, and vote on projects across technical, business, creative, and community domains. It emphasizes the power of collective action, inviting participation from anyone, regardless of their background or location. The initiative has supported many proposals and engaged a vast community, highlighting its impact and the extensive opportunities for involvement​.
