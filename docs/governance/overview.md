![Cardano Governance](../../static/img/card-governance-title.svg)

Cardano was designed with the intent of long-term sustainability in mind. The goal was to build a system that could govern and fund itself without relying on donations. Cardano includes a built-in treasury system that receives revenue via transaction fees and treasury taxes on a regular basis. This is explained in detail in [treasuries with Bingsheng Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyh3h_yX-S0). 

## Cardano Improvement Proposal

[Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)](cardano-improvement-proposals/CIP-0001) are a way of formally proposing ideas in an agreed-upon fashion. While they are not binding and are not a need for either treasury or protocol changes, they are an important component of Cardano governance. Someone must propose a setup for others to discuss before a decision can be made.

## Fund your project with Project Catalyst

The present means to access the funds of the treasury system is through [Project Catalyst](project-catalyst), Cardano's innovation platform. It is considered as a stepping stone to Voltaire and strives to give a safe and exciting setting in which to explore human collaboration's highest potential.
