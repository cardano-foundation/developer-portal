[Project Catalyst](project-catalyst) should be your tool of choice when it comes to project funding on Cardano. For the sake of completeness, here is a place to list alternative funding options for your project.

## The cFund

The [cFund](https://cfund.vc/) is a venture fund that manages all centralized fund operations secured by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) and [Wave Financial](https://wavegp.com/) where each of them participated with 10$ million to back ambitious founders globally. 

The [cFund](https://cfund.vc/) is a homage to Apple's iFund that was introduced in 2008 to bootstrap iOS development. Compared to Project Catalyst, the funds available here are relatively small.

The **cFund** started in July 2020 with the goals to achieve:
* Growing the Cardano ecosystem.
* Working with governments, especially in developing countries in Africa and South America.
* Providing access to high-speed, adaptable financing for founders to manage payment flows and invest in the Cardano ecosystem.

The first **cFund** investment took place In April 2021. It provided $500,000 to innovative enterprise-grade fintech technology called [COTI, the currency of the internet](https://coti.io/). **COTI** secured the investment to support stakeholder-driven payment solutions and enables them to pack digitally any currency.
