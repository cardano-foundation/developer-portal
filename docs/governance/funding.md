Cardano offers one of the most comprehensive and decentralized funding ecosystems in blockchain. From grassroots innovation to large-scale infrastructure, find the right funding path for your project.

## Project Catalyst - Community Innovation Engine

Project Catalyst is the world's largest decentralized grant program, distributing over **+$150M** across **+2000** funded proposals through community voting.

Visit the official [Project Catalyst website](https://projectcatalyst.io/) to explore current funding opportunities and active campaigns.

## How It Works

Project Catalyst operates in three phases:

1) Community responds to challenges with ideas. Brainstorming leads to conceptualization, feedback, and finalized proposals.

2) Participants vote on proposals they wish to see funded. Results are tallied and shared transparently after voting ends.

3) Selected projects receive milestone-based funding with community guidance and regular progress reports.

## Why Participate?

- Build better, faster, and cheaper through community empowerment
- Connect with collaborators and form impactful project teams  
- Improve proposals through constructive community feedback
- Access millions in ada grants for your innovative ideas

## Treasury Withdrawals - Large-Scale Funding

For mature projects with proven impact, Cardano's on-chain governance enables **Treasury withdrawals** - multi-million ada funding proposals voted on by the community.

**When to Consider:**

- Established project with proven product-market fit
- Significant ecosystem impact and utilization
- Large-scale infrastructure or protocol improvements
- Community-wide benefit and long-term value

Treasury proposals require approval from **DReps** (Delegated Representatives) and the **Constitutional Committee** through Cardano's governance system.

Learn more about [Treasury withdrawals](cardano-governance/governance-actions.md#treasury-withdrawals).

## Funding Pathway

Cardano's funding ecosystem creates a natural progression for projects:

1. **Start Small** - Use Project Catalyst grants (typically $5K-$500K) to validate ideas and build MVPs
2. **Prove Value** - Demonstrate product-market fit, user adoption, and ecosystem benefit  
3. **Scale Big** - Access Treasury withdrawals (multi-million ada) for major infrastructure and growth

This pathway ensures sustainable funding allocation while supporting innovation at every stage.
