![Cardano Operate a Stake Pool](../../static/img/card-operate-a-stake-pool-title.svg)

There are excellent guidelines available on how to set up cardano-node as a stake pool. You may even set one up without any prior Linux experience or concern for best practices. Simply copy and paste the commands from the instructions into your shell.

Unfortunately, simply getting your node up and running is insufficient. You must be able to manage, update, and safeguard it. To do so, you must first comprehend what you are doing.

After you've mastered these fundamentals, you'll need to market your stake pool effectively in order to make it a success.

## The Big Picture

Learn fundamental terms like blockchain, consensus, decentralization delegation and incentives. Understand the big picture of Cardano and why stake pools are so important.

:::tip questions or suggestions?
If you have any questions and suggestions while taking the lessons please feel free to [ask in the Cardano forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/staking-delegation/setup-a-stake-pool/158) and we will respond as soon as possible.

## What are the prerequisites for persons who wish to learn how to run a stake pool?
- Knowledge of how to manage a server. You must be familiar with the operating system of your choosing in order to administer, maintain, and secure your server.
- This includes a thorough understanding of how networks operate, as well as how to backup and restore data.
- Experienced in interpreting documentation and implementing best practices
- Understand Cardano, blockchain, wallets, and key pairs on a fundamental level.

## What if I don't meet the requirements?
If you don't meet all of the qualifications, you'll need a strong desire to study and the understanding that you won't be able to learn everything in a few weeks.

We observed people who had no prior knowledge of Linux, shells, or networking, but who were committed and had enough time to properly deal with it, and who now manage a profitable stake pool. It isn't for everyone, and it isn't going to be simple. Here are a few resources to get you started:
- [Start playing around with Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).
- [Stake pool operator forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/staking-delegation/156).
- [Cardano Stake Pool Best Practice Workgroup](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup).


## Choose security over comfort
Best procedures should always be a key consideration when running a stake pool. Security isn't something you can turn on or off or change in a configuration file. It is both an attitude and a way of life.
- [Discuss security related topics with stake pool operators](https://forum.cardano.org/c/staking-delegation/stake-pool-security/157).

## Cardano Key Pairs
It's critical to understand the numerous cryptographic key pairs connected with Cardano, as well as the purpose of each key pair and best practices for securing those keys, before you start working with it. Every ambitious Cardano developer and stake pool operator should get a complete grasp of these key pairs, as well as the ramifications of a single secret (private) key being hacked. Any Cardano developer or stake pool operator must learn how to manage, safeguard, and store private keys in order to succeed.

Cardano cryptographic keys are made up of `ed25519` key pairs, which include a `public verification key file` and a `secret (private) key file`. The public key file is commonly referred to as `keyname.vkey`, whereas the private key file is referred to as `keyname.skey`. The private key file, which is used to sign transactions, is extremely sensitive and should be adequately safeguarded. Under all circumstances, this entails limiting third-party access to your private keys. The most effective technique to prevent private key exposure is to guarantee that the necessary private key is never held for any length of time on any internet-connected machine (hot node). Please note that key pair filenames are completely random and can be named whatever you want.

:::danger
Use extreme caution to avoid losing or overwriting secret (private) keys.

## Wallet address key pairs

Currently, Cardano wallet addresses only have two parts: a payment address and a counterpart staking address. A payment address (together with its associated key pairs) is used to store, receive, and send money. A stake address (and related keys) is used to store and withdraw rewards, as well as to define the stake pool owner and rewards accounts, as well as the wallet's target stake pool delegation.


`payment.vkey` is the public verification key file for the payment address (not sensitive; may be shared publicly).

`payment.skey` is a highly sensitive payment address secret (private) signing key file. The private signing key file gives you access to monies in your payment address and should be kept safe at all times.

:::danger
Never place payment signing keys on a hot node.
:::


`stake.vkey` - stake address public verification key file (not sensitive; may be shared publicly).

`stake.skey` - It is a sensitive stake address secret (private) signing key file. This private signing key file gives you access to any awards cash held in the stake address, as well as the ability to delegate the wallet to a pool. It's also a good idea to keep an eye on the stake.skey.

`payment.addr` - This is a Cardano wallet payment address that is usually generated with the help of both a payment.vkey and a stake. As inputs, use the vkey file. If a payment address is merely going to be used to send and receive money, no crucial components need to be staked. In addition, there is a single payment. Multiple unique stake.vkey files can be coupled with vkey to establish different payment addresses that can be staked independently.


`stake.addr` - stake address for a Cardano wallet and is generated using the stake.vkey file

## Cardano stake pool key pairs

### Stake pool cold keys

`cold.skey` - secret (private) signing key file for a Cardano stake pool (extremely sensitive). The `cold.skey` is required to register a stake pool, to update a stake pool registration certificate parameters, to rotate a stake pool KES keys and to retire a stake pool.


`cold.vkey` - public verification key file for a stake pool's cold.skey private signing key file (cold.vkey is not sensitive; can be shared publicly).


`cold.counter` - incrementing counter file that tracks the number of times an operational certificate (opcert) has been generated for the relevant stake pool.

:::danger
Always rotate KES keys using the latest `cold.counter`.
:::

### VRF hot keys

`vrf.skey` - secret (private) signing key file for a Cardano stake pool's VRF key (required to start a stake pool's block producing node; sensitive but must be placed on a hot node in order to start a stake pool).

`vrf.vkey` - public verification key file for a Cardano stake pool's vrf.skey (not sensitive and is not required to start a stake pool's block producing node).

### KES hot keys

`kes.skey`- secret (private) signature key file for the stake pool's KES key (needed to start the stake pool's block producing node; sensitive, but must be placed on a hot node to start a stake pool and rotated on a regular basis). KES keys are needed to establish a stake pool's operating certificate, which expires 90 days after the opcert's defined KES period has passed. As a result, fresh KES keys must be generated along with a new opcert every 90 days or sooner for a Cardano Stake pool to continue minting blocks.

`kes.vkey` - public verification key file for a Cardano stake pool's corresponding `kes.skey` (not sensitive and is not required to a block producer).
