Stake pool operators play an important role in the Cardano Ecosystem. On one hand they have the responsibility to keep the network running by providing robust nodes that continually verify transactions and on another hand pay best Return on Stake (RoS) to their delegators. Operating a stake pool requires the commitment to monitor the nodes 24/7 and ability to react immediately to fullfil both of these requirements. Some of the technical skill a stake pool operator should have are as follows:

## What are the prerequisites for persons who wish to learn how to run a stake pool?

- Knowledge of how to manage a server. You must be familiar with the operating system of your choosing in order to administer, maintain, and secure your server.
- This includes a thorough understanding of how networks operate, as well as how to backup and restore data.
- Experienced in interpreting documentation and implementing best practices
- Understand Cardano, blockchain, wallets, and key pairs on a fundamental level.

## What if I don't meet the requirements?

If you don't meet all of the qualifications, you'll need a strong desire to study and the understanding that you won't be able to learn everything in a few weeks.

We observed people who had no prior knowledge of Linux, shells, or networking, but who were committed and had enough time to properly deal with it, and who now manage a profitable stake pool. It isn't for everyone, and it isn't going to be simple. Here are a few resources to get you started:

- [Start playing around with Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).
- [Stake pool operator forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/staking-delegation/156).
- [Cardano Stake Pool Best Practice Workgroup](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup).

## Choose security over comfort

Best procedures should always be a key consideration when running a stake pool. Security isn't something you can turn on or off or change in a configuration file. It is both an attitude and a way of life.

- [Discuss security related topics with stake pool operators](https://forum.cardano.org/c/staking-delegation/stake-pool-security/157).
- [Security Best Practices](../get-started/air-gap).

In order to provide the best RoS to delegators, a pools has to produce blocks and higher the delegation the more blocks it produces resulting in higher RoS. So, a pool operator needs the skills for attracting delegators to the pool, which usually is the toughest part when starting a new pool. Every new pool operator should device a strategy before starting a pool.
