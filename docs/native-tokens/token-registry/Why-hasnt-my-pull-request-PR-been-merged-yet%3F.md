Pull Requests are managed by humans and we are doing our best to make this a diligent process: Requests are generally treated from the oldest first; please be patient üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

If your PR is one of the older ones, there might be a few things going on, which should be indicated on the PR itself. Make sure your PR is properly formatted: Each goes through a set of automated tests that check details against the schema.
The status of your validation checks is indicated by:

**a green checkmark**: means the automatic checks are **passing fine**.

**a red 'x'**: means the automatic checks are **not passing**. To get more details about why it is failing, click on 'details' in the check section and scroll to the bottom of the resulting page, it will give you more info. 

Although we strive to go over every PR, we typically process the well-formatted / checks-validated PRs first. It is in your best interest to make sure your PR passes the automated checks put in place!
