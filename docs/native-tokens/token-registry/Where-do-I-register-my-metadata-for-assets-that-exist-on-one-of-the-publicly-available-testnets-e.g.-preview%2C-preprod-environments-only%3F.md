This repository is the metadata registry for **mainnet** assets only. If you intend to register any metadata for on-chain assets that exist on the publicly available testnets only (e.g. preview and preprod environments) please use the [metadata-registry from IOHK](https://github.com/input-output-hk/metadata-registry-testnet).
