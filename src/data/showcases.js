/*
 * ADD YOUR SITE TO THE CARDANO DEVELOPER PORTAL SHOWCASE:
 *
 * Requirements for adding your site to our showcase:
 * - It must be built on Cardano and have a real usecase. Preferably but not necessarily dapps.
 *   Please exclude pooltools and explorers for the time being.
 * - It has a stable domain name (a random Netlify/Vercel domain is not allowed)
 * - The code is publicly available (not decided yet if this is a requirement)
 *
 * Instructions:
 * - Add your site in the json array below, in alphabetical order of title
 * - Add a local image preview (decent screenshot of your site)
 *
 * The image must be added to the GitHub repository, and use `require("image")`
 *
 * Example PR: FIXME: provide example PR in the future
 *
 * If you edit this file through the Github interface, you can:
 * - Submit first your showcase.js edit PR
 * - This will create a branch on your Docusaurus fork (usually "patch-1")
 * - Go to https://github.com/<username>/developer-portal/tree/<branch>/website/src/data/showcase
 * - Drag-and-drop an image here to add it to your existing PR
 *
