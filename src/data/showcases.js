/*
 * SHOWCASE SECTION INFO
 *
 * The project showcase should be a place where someone new to the ecosystem 
 * can come to see what can be done - it should not be seen as a database where 
 * every project is promoted.
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDING YOUR PROJECT TO THE SHOWCASE SECTION:
 * - It must be built on Cardano and have a real use case. For example, a forum where 
 *   people can talk about Cardano is great, but nothing for this showcase section.
 * - It has to run on Cardano mainnet.
 * - It has to have a running product. (no presale, no protected pages, no coming soon messages)
 * - It has to have enough community reputation.
 * - It has to provide a unique value from existing showcase items. (we can't list 
 *   thousands of NFT or native tokens with the current UI)
 * - It has to have a stable domain name. (a random Netlify/Vercel domain is not allowed, no 
 *   URL shortener, no app store links, or similar)
 * - The GitHub account that adds the project must not be new. 
 * - The GitHub account must have a history/or already be known in the Cardano community.
 * - Describe what makes your project special, avoid phrases like "the first this and that". Granular 
 *   details like which project was first is tribal attribute known to cause rift and conflicts.
 *
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * - Add your project in the JSON array below.
 * - Add a local image preview. (decent screenshot or logo of your project)
 * - The image must be added to the GitHub repository and use `require("image")`.
